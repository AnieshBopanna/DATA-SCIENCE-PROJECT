# Sentiment Analysis and Spam Detection on Comments from YouTube

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the sentiment and detect spam in comments from YouTube videos. By performing sentiment analysis, we can gain insights into the sentiment expressed by viewers towards the video content. Additionally, detecting and filtering out spam comments is crucial for maintaining a positive user experience and promoting meaningful interactions on the platform.

## Problem Statement
YouTube hosts a vast amount of user-generated content, accompanied by comments from viewers. Analyzing the sentiment of these comments helps understand how users perceive and engage with the content. Furthermore, identifying and filtering out spam comments ensures that the comments section remains relevant and free from unwanted content.

## Approach
To accomplish the goals of sentiment analysis and spam detection on YouTube comments, we will follow these steps:

1. Data Collection: Utilize the YouTube Data API to extract comments from selected videos or channels. Gather relevant information such as comment text, author, timestamp, and video metadata.

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the comment text by removing special characters, URLs, excessive whitespace, and non-informative words. Tokenize the text into individual words or phrases and apply techniques like stemming or lemmatization to normalize the text.

3. Sentiment Analysis: Build a sentiment analysis model using supervised learning techniques. Train the model on a labeled dataset where comments are manually annotated with sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral). Explore various machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to achieve accurate sentiment classification.

4. Spam Detection: Develop a spam detection model to identify and filter out spam comments. Train the model using supervised learning algorithms with a labeled dataset containing examples of spam and non-spam comments. Consider features such as comment length, presence of URLs, excessive capitalization, or common spam keywords to accurately detect and classify spam comments.

5. Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the sentiment analysis and spam detection models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score. Split the labeled dataset into training and testing sets to measure the models' generalization performance.

6. Model Deployment: Deploy the trained sentiment analysis and spam detection models into a production environment. Create a user interface or API endpoints for real-time sentiment analysis and spam detection on YouTube comments.

7. Data Visualization and Insights: Visualize sentiment distributions, word clouds, or sentiment trends over time to gain insights into viewer sentiment towards different videos or topics. Analyze the results of spam detection to identify patterns, common spam characteristics, or emerging spam trends.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries/Frameworks: YouTube Data API, Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries (NLTK, spaCy), Machine Learning libraries (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras), Data Visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Expected Outcome
- Trained models for sentiment analysis and spam detection on YouTube comments.
- Deployment of the models with a user interface or API endpoints for real-time analysis.
- Insights into viewer sentiment towards YouTube videos and identification of spam patterns.
- Visualization of sentiment distributions and spam detection results.

## Project Status
The project is currently under development. Data collection, preprocessing, and model training are in progress. The sentiment analysis and spam detection models will be evaluated and fine-tuned to achieve optimal performance. Further work will include model deployment, data visualization, and generating insights from the results.
