13854,"Gaining an understanding of our world in 50% done by you being on Youtube.  You need to go to a couple channels, one had Peter Zeihan an entertaining genius on Geopolitics.  He doesn&#39;t have all the big answers, but he is close enough.  You&#39;ll learn that Russia&#39;s largest threat is China which has a crashing demographic, and only 3% of its land mass can be farmed.  It is suffering a water shortage and it is eyeing Lake Baikal which has four times the fresh water of all the Great Lakes combined.  Russia acquired Outer Mongolia with 12 million living on many times the size of Texas.  There are 110 million Chinese just over the border.  Russia only had 8 million men of military service age.  Now  over one million have left and more will be leaving.  Russia doesn&#39;t have enough troops to guard their infinitely long border, well not that long but you get my gist.  <br><br>Chestnia (sic?) has 2-3 million troops.  It won one and lost one war with Putin.  When Ukraine cuts off Crimea which it will do before fall, Putin is toast.  He won&#39;t use nukes, because our electronic information knows his every location.  He knows we know.  He knows he can be obliterated without a nuke or even a bomb.  The US already sliced and diced a bad guy in Afghanistan with a missile that didn&#39;t explode it hit him on a balcony and cut his body worse than Humpty Dumpty.  No one else was touched.  The balcony did not come down.<br><br>This may be the last wore the world will experience.  There are no wars between established democracies.  Russia and China are the two biggest non democratic players, and they will be gone in 10 years or less.   The young people of Iran will fix that rogue religious player.  North Korea, does anybody have a guess?    <br><br>Our CIA has been wrong on all the big issues of its life time.  It led us to Viet Nam, Iraq, and Afghanistan none of which did us any good, however, President Johnson, paid for his war.  The newer ones were added to national debt.  Saying America has a democracy is partially true, but it is a crooked system.  When I entered the work force, my $10,000 income would now be $80,000.  What college grad of any subject earns half of that.  When I left college  50 % of growth went to labor and the other half went to management.  In the 1970, big business decided to make a play for all of it.  They are 90% successful.  The tops of each business made 20 times the lowest worker, now it is hundreds of times!  <br><br>These guys are sincere, but woefully uninformed, and maybe more than a little bit ignorant.  But then we all are.  I do not find their discussion worth the time.  No country has paid any of their debt from WWII to America.  The USA was the big winner after that calamity.  We had to pay to rebuild the world and we did, but we did not bill anybody in the process.  Before going to war FDR had his statisticians figure the probability that we would win the war.  The answer he entered the war was 1.0 or Certainty.  It didn&#39;t matter what we did, we would win!  Without American aid which was major, The Soviets, Russia, would have lost to Germany.  After WWI   <br>the Allies won in the west and we got reparations from Germany, but they won in the east and got reparations from Russia!<br><br>Until Trump, most GAYS were Republicans even if they weren&#39;t welcome. That excludes the gay Jews who are attorneys, go figure.  Blue dog Democrats became so called patriotic Republicans after Johnson gave Blacks the vote.  Crime is 40% higher in Republican held cities.  The speaker of the house had Bakersfield, CA as his home town and the crime rate is much higher than San Fransisco!    <br><br>There are no more spies in the World the any more.  They weren&#39;t any good at anyway.   America doesn&#39;t have a security system that can keep a secret.  When so called secrets get out they often do more good than bad.  Means, methods and those exposed may be hurt or worse.  Saying &#39;I was a spy&#39; means what?  It means one sought and related information.  It need not be in the first person.  Every expert was wrong about Ukraine falling in DAYS.  That includes our elected officials, our military brass, and our spy agencies.  Putin will be out and Russia will break up into a dozen states.  Main land China insists there is only one country.  However, why would Hong Kong or Taiwan want the mess the so called communists have made?  Their politburo is a billionaires club with black shoe polish on their hair.  <br><br>Biden has been the most successful president in your life time, but he is afraid to tell the truth about the war.  &quot;Ukraine must and will win&quot;  Russia will loose.  If Ukraine should be over run, the Russians must live in forts, if they go out they will be killed.   China has a large navy, but 90% can&#39;t sail 400 miles.  90% of US ships can and do!   Two us destroyers can block the straights off the Malayan Peninsula and cut off 75% of China&#39;s energy supplies, Oil and gas<br><br>Most Americans, including me, like to stay &#39;comfortably dumb&#39;!  Police are in more danger in a vehicle that facing the public.  They are in more danger alone that in their vehicle.  Why, they are injured and die in vehicle accidents than worrying about their safety with the public.  They die from suicide much more than behind the wheel.  Their job is 22 on the list of most dangerous.  80% of cops never shoot their gun in 20 years on the force.  More than that who are called &#39;good cops&#39; don&#39;t call out their fllow cops when witnessing  criminal behavior.

We considered you in debt to us. However, as soon as the last nuke left Ukrainian territory and the last Kh-22 was cut into small pieces, Ukraine was left alone to handle all its problems on its own. Meanwhile, the US and other Western countries established a steady flow of money to Russia, as if intentionally turning their backs on Ukraine. A small but accurate example: McDonald&#39;s opened in Ukraine more than a decade later than in Russia. PayPal still doesn&#39;t work in Ukraine. Investments in railroads, energy infrastructure, and humanitarian aid have primarily flowed into Russia&#39;s economy, leaving Ukraine in the dust, desperately trying to catch up.<br><br>Your closest ally in Europe, Germany, opened dozens of manufacturing facilities in Russia, while I struggle to name even one in Ukraine.

Since they answer to nobody, they&#39;re basically free to run around like American versions of so called middle east terrorist groups, but instead of acting as proxies for countries like Hamas does for Iran and Al-Quaeda did for the Taliban when they were running Afghanistan in the runup to America invasion, they run around selling weapons to all sides of every conflict. <br><br>Also, one way or another, governments do need to have the hearts and minds of enough of their people to stay in power. That&#39;s how Castro kept control in Cuba for most of his life...my parents visited Cuba for about 6 weeks and came back and told me although most people weren&#39;t rich, they wholeheartedly loved Fidel Castro. He let everyone who wanted to be rich, and criminals, and those who were unhappy with the way of life come to the US 20 years after he took power from a right wing authoritarian, Bautista. But when my parents went there, they saw no homeless people, people owning their own homes and businesses, and a system where children are evaluated in school to find their interests and talents, and by the time they get to high school and college (which are free), they focus on learning that trade, whether it&#39;s running a business, becoming an artist or dancer, but there is a priority to find and train scientists, doctors, what we call &quot;STEM&quot; subjects. So he was able even after the fall of the USSR to be a self sustaining country that feeds, houses, educates, and provides jobs to everyone. And although it&#39;s behind most of the world technologically, it doesn&#39;t try to stick its nose into other countries&#39; interests unless not doing so affects its ability to maintain a certain quality of life. That&#39;s why they sent troops to Venezuela to help prevent the coup America tried to pull there. <br><br>When it comes to China, the reason Xi has recently made moves to remove party members who don&#39;t fully agree with him, and changed the constitution to hold onto power, control information, lock up 3 generations of families of people who show dissent, and the reason the CCP has locked people in their houses is because he began losing hearts and minds of the people. Notice how this CIA guy didn&#39;t mention the protests going on in China right now...people are protesting all over China and avoiding for the most part getting locked up is by taping their mouths and marching with blank sheets of paper. This lowers their social credit and labels them for life as trouble makers, and since they are young for the most part, this will affect their ability to work, to move around without being watched and having the police come into their homes at 3am and tearing apart their lives. One person can only rule over 1.4 billion people for so long when a single act of trying to speak freely or be free leads to a lifetime of harassment for the whole family. <br>He didn&#39;t speak of the Russian citizens protesting the war and groups of them sabotaging their own country&#39;s war efforts. But rural Chinese and Russians are used to self sustained farming, and have no idea what is going on outside of their prefecture. The cities are a different story. People have been protesting Putin for years. They may get locked up, but people who are locked up cost money, they don&#39;t contribute to the economy. Every country in the world is 3 days of missed meals away from full on rebellion. <br><br>Any intelligence officer knows this, he is so used to propagansizing that it&#39;s programmed into his brain. How does he think China and Cuba became what they are in the first place? During WWII, China was in the midst of a Civil War at the same time as they were fighting the Japanese. It&#39;s because in times of social unrest when people know the status quo isn&#39;t working, the people want change, and some turn to right wing ideologies and others (the poor majority and intellectuals who empathize with them and are anti-authoritarian) turn to left wing ideologies. That&#39;s what happened in the Spanish Civil War, WWII, the KoreanWar, pretty much every war since 1919 was all about the rich right wing minority fighting off left wing movements.

For example, this is a skill a number of survivors of abusive relationships develop.<br><br>Granted, I may be nitpicking, as I think I understand what&#39;s being said and would be shocked if this person isn&#39;t aware of all this magnified by several magnitudes.  However, they didn&#39;t provide additional context or supply more information.  The conversation moved on.  It was indirectly touched on, but I may have been connecting dots that don&#39;t exist.<br><br><b>*</b><br><br>&quot;Things that can do such tremendous damage that we will never recover.&quot;  Does this include &quot;things&quot; such as the tenure of the 45th United States President?<br><br><b>*</b><br><br>I find it interesting that matters are allegedly run by the President, as they&#39;re usually not an expert in any of them (and thus unable to make the best decisions).  For example, some of the Presidents in the history of the United States haven&#39;t been smart and/or wise.  I&#39;ve always supported variations of axioms regarding leaders being as good as those they surround themselves with.  A good leader knows their limits and defers to those better versed in different arenas.  This is touched upon during the course of this conversation.<br><br><b>*</b><br><br>It&#39;s disappointing when people speak outside their wheelhouse (within this context).

15358,"I was absolutely amazed to hear Lex raving about Zelenskyy&#39;s supposed popularity in the West. How can a person so intelligent be so blind to the reality of the situation? <br><br>When Russia demanded that Ukraine remain neutral and abandon its hopes of joining NATO, it was an eminently reasonable - albeit unfair - proposal. But Zelenskyy rejected it out of hand, despite the fact that Ukraine had no realistic chance of joining NATO in the first place, given its ongoing territorial dispute. Anyone with even a passing familiarity with the situation could see that. <br><br>Was Zelenskyy high on something? Who knows, he does sniffle a lot. <br><br>As the Pope himself noted, it seemed like someone was actively trying to stir up a war. And as we all know, the stronger party tends to get their way in these situations. Look at Cuba, still struggling under the punishing weight of American sanctions because they dared to defy the stronger power. Pragmatism pays.<br><br>Was it really worth it for Ukraine to take that risk? Absolutely not.

15359,"As an outside observer, I was surprised to hear Andrew suggest intelligence failures bear some responsibility for America&#39;s decline. From the external perspective, the issues plaguing the country seem purely domestic. Political polarisation has paralysed progress, while powerful plutocrats control the government like marionettes. It is shocking just how much Americans hate each other based on their left and right distinctions. The leaders encourage it. <br><br>When pharmaceutical companies pushed for vaccine mandates to ensure they got their desired profits, both parties remained largely silent. Jobs were outsourced to China by American captains of industry acting of their own volition, looking to make more money, not by the scheming of foreign influences. <br><br>Unfortunately, there appears to be no hope for change. A unifying leader would be necessary, but such a figure would struggle to emerge in a corrupt system. Even Obama was a fraud. I was shocked to see him endorsing the magic juice, betraying the common man. <br><br>Meanwhile, the normalisation of unscientific beliefs and disregard for biological reality is absurdly gaining dominance, who him her what?

(Personal incredulity fallacy).<br><br>Based on descriptive and predictive analysis processes, the negative comments handles, and the vernacular used: Stop playing video games and watching 3 hour podcasts to come up with some snarky comments - it&#39;s petty, and poses the question of your broad time-management skills.

If a similar situation happens again and the same husband is involved we are obviously even more suspicious. However, the term ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù prevents rational discourse (and rational thinking). DeHaven suggests the term ‚Äústate crimes against democracy‚Äù. He makes the point that if we do not have a word for a crime it is very difficult to discuss it, especially if argumentators are discredited and ostracized as ‚Äúconspiracy theorists‚Äù and categorized next to flat-earth believers (viz. invalid associations are created to facilitate superficial social categorisation).",T3FC7qIAGZk,2023-01-17T06:57:56Z,0.0,0.0,True,False,False,-0.013888888888888895,0.5187499999999999,0

16369,"Love Lex...and Joe Rogan....but when they do these interviews with ex spooks....it&#39;s always the same story. They talk out of both sides of their mouth (as they are trained to do) and assume the general public is too stupid to catch them in all of their lies and hypocrisy. For instance....Mr Bustamante would have you simultaneously believe that all the intelligence failures of the CIA are just &quot;embarrassing missteps&quot; and that&#39;s why no one from the agency wants to discuss them....but at the same time...he was &quot;so impressed&quot; to be working with the brightest and best people he has ever met, (working in one of the most competent agencies with GLOBAL reach and power.) So...the Afghanistan draw down, 911, January 6th, Hong Kong, Ukraine....all of these intelligence failures were just people not being at their best???  (face palm). <br><br>A more BELIEVABLE narrative is...and one that is in line with his own comments are....the CIA works for &quot;the client&quot; (POTUS) (Bustamantes&#39; words) and they are there to do his bidding and execute his directives. In reality (perfect world) the CLIENT is the American people (the first among many glaring problems with Bustamantes world view), POTUS is just the steward. Currently....a handful of billionaires choose the POTUS....and they all have their geopolitical agendas they expect to be carried out by whatever Administration is in power (the billionaires expect obedience from the people they buy). The CIA then is actually working to execute operations that support the agendas of billionaires....not the will or best interests of the American people. All those intelligence &quot;failures&quot; benefited the rich and powerful. For instance, US oil barons make a bundle when we are at war, when there is a &quot;perceived shortfall in commodities&quot;, when there is any excuse/justification to jack up the costs of durable goods and/or manipulate prices via the stock market, via futures, derivatives and all the other arcane (criminal) methods of resource manipulation/exploitation. Same goes for durable goods, food stuffs, building materials....practically everything. Shortages (created artificially) drives demand...and thus drives profits to ever increasing levels.<br><br>As for his negative comments and view of Snowden....again...Bustamante conveniently forgets about William Binney....and how the NSA and the rest of the intelligence apparatus tried to throw Binney and his team under the bus when they blew the whistle on corruption within the NSA. Lucky for Binney and his team, they were smarter than the scumbags that tried to throw them in jail forever. Snowden took note of Binneys&#39; treatment and thought wisely that if the NSA was willing to throw Binney in the slammer for 20+ years (Binney was a 36 year vet of the intelligence community and ex military vet) then what would they be willing to do to him?  Yeah....PHUCK Bustamante....sideways with a 2x4. Just another CIA apologist out there spreading lies and trying to manipulate public opinion...to whitewash all the dirty laundry of our intelligence apparatus. If January 6th was just an embarrassing misstep by our intelligence agencies ....then maybe Congress should reevaluate the BILLIONS we spend on the various intelligence departments if they can&#39;t manage to maintain law and order in our own capital on the most important day of the year (transfer of power). Either that...or several TOP department heads, generals and other top directors should be SACKED for gross incompetence, cowardice....or better yet...charged and sent to trial for seditious treason. <br><br>Even Bustamantes&#39; comment that &quot;Trump did a good thing by stripping ex intelligence officials of their security clearance once they leave government employment&quot;. That comment alone REEKS of fascism/authoritarianism. It suggests that people (American citizens) should only be trusted to safeguard the nations secrets when they are executing the demands of the current administration and their agenda. I would argue that obtaining a security clearance is a litmus test for how trustworthy you are as a CITIZEN...and that your duty to country follows you wherever you decide to work (government or private sector). Stripping people of their security clearances would be akin to stripping people of their law license every time they left a firm, or a Dr of his medical license every time they switched hospitals. It would cripple our brain trust in the private sector intelligence services (which has boomed since the Republicans thought it was such a great idea to outsource mission critical services back in the 1980-90s). His comments are simultaneously ignorant, specious and hubristic. I could go on and tear apart his views of &quot;security vs freedom&quot;...but why bother...he has already demonstrated that he has NO IDEA what a democracy is.",T3FC7qIAGZk,2023-01-16T23:33:45Z,0.0,0.0,True,False,False,0.18529143897996359,0.4472222222222222,1

When Andrew started explaining what it would take for them to actually carry something like that out he seems to have explained almost what happened in a country that borders America with a red and white flag with a leaf, when people took to the streets to protest about the government during covid. Unlike many other protests around the world where people were injured and places were vandalized or destroyed, this freedom protest was a very peaceful and strategized protest that caused no pain or suffering to the people they just targeted the government and economics by limiting transportation. I&#39;d like to get your opinion on this matter and how the government reacted to this because I feel like it is very closely tied into what you two explained about freedom of speech and how a government can step in to show it&#39;s power. They enacted the emergency act which we are still unaware if that was legal or necessary and then they brought in an outside police force to stop and jail the people protesting.

If they didn&#39;t do that they would&#39;ve completely thrown the ROC in Taiwan under the bus, and they just didn&#39;t do that.

18091,"@lexfridman Thinking about the alien conversation‚Ä¶ I am thinking how you‚Äôre thinking, as far as the best way to learn about, and observe a species not of your own‚Ä¶ Is to infiltrate them in someway that they don‚Äôt know you exist. So is it possible that they are or have been for hundreds or thousands of years, interbreeding with the human species. Every once in a while, creating a crossbreed that is more alien than human and therefore can think on levels that others can‚Äôt. Einstein comes to mind, Elon Musk comes to mind. Copernicus, etc.. where they are thinking on a higher plane, then most of us can.<br><br>Which is where our inventions and theoretical ideas come to light, and we are able to advance as a civilization. Not because the human race is getting smarter, but because some of the human race is a crossbreed between human and alien species, and because the aliens are more advanced‚Ä¶ Some of that information leaks into these people.<br><br>In a lot of ways, which Joe Rogan said many times on his podcast, we are still kind of dumb apes. In the fact that we don‚Äôt act as a human race, we are sanctioned in our own packs‚Ä¶ With our own beliefs, and instead of finding ways to get along with each other, we choose war. Trying to dominate other sanctions, land, and resources. Not caring for the species as a whole, but just the pack we run with. The leaders of these packs are using propaganda in order to trick the rest of their population into believing what they want them to believe. Simply to corral the troops to carry out their agenda.<br><br>I am just kind of spit balling. But I would love to hear your opinion on it. It makes more sense that alien races would live among us to find out our intricacies in order to better understand what they are dealing with. Which, if that is the case‚Ä¶ if they are as advanced as many believe they are, they would probably think we are bumbling idiots.

Ukraine has enormous natural energy and food ressources and whoever can have it in its sphere of influence is increasing the amount of power it can project in many places around the world. That makes Ukraine a strategic asset for any power, Nato included, even if those resources are not primarily directed into our economies. In reality we&#39;re supporting Ukraine, and the only reason we&#39;re not physically fighting Russia is the risk of nuclear escalation.

The red team doesn&#39;t do that very much!! It is the blue team that will blindly go against anything if the red team shows they&#39;re interested or care about something! It could literally be anything and if I wouldn&#39;t even say the red team I would say everyone who isn&#39;t a low information that shit crazy leftist cult member who will literally fight with everything they&#39;ve got in order to shut down any type of conversation that goes against their views and will do anything in order to not see or hear any type of information except for their narrative! Then there&#39;s everyone else not just Republicans! Although everyone has pretty much had to run to the Republicans because there&#39;s nowhere else for them to go! It&#39;s no longer even all that political! anyone who is inquisitive, seeks out information from numerous sources from numerous viewpoints/worldviews/narratives! Anyone who is interested in national &amp; world events and actively seeks out information and uses common sense and critical thinking skill to determine what they believe is as close as possible to the truth  no matter if it aligns with their beliefs and preferred narrative because they are actually interested in finding out what the truth really is and is will<br> To consistently spends time and energy putting in the effort to stay as current as possible! This is not the &quot;right!&quot; Not because of their politics, beliefs, lifestyle, etc BUT BECAUSE THAT&#39;S THE ONLY OPTION AND THE RADICAL LEFTIST CULT LABEL&#39;S THEM AS &quot;THE ALT RIGHT&quot; IF THEY DON&#39;T BEND THE KNEE AND SUBMIT TO FOLLOWING AND AGREEING WITH WHATEVER THE LEFT IS SAYING THEY BELIEVE IS &quot;THE TRUTH&quot; AT THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT BASED ON WHATEVER THE DEMONRATS AND THEIR PROPAGANDA MACHINE THEY CALL THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA TELLS THEM! That is the difference between the left and the right at this time! One is ignorant and low information and will do anything in order to stay that way and the other is inquisitive and seeks out knowledge! The so called right that is made up of everyone that isn&#39;t a leftist cult member including centrists, libertarian and even many Democrats! The people that are on the right would have every warning, red siren and voice screaming yeah watch out! Definitely something wrong here! WTF would someone tell you this for unless they are lying to you and hiding everything from you like you know they are because you watch as they tell you one thing and say everyone who doesn&#39;t believe it is the most horrible human being on the planet only to say the exact opposite the next day! The left on the other hand turns into CNN like always to see what they are supposed to be saying thinking and believing today and they hear Brian stelter come on and tell them &quot;thinking for themselves and doing your own research is dangerous! We&#39;re the only ones telling the truth! Everyone else is lying so don&#39;t even bother looking anywhere else for information we&#39;ve got you covered!&quot; And not only does it not set off every warning and scream caution to the left but they saw it as what a groundbreaking piece of philosophical brilliance! We should adopt this and use it as our life mottos! I feel bad for him because I don&#39;t think she sees that only the left is ranting and raving about Ukraine and how important it is saying we must send them billions of dollars and while we&#39;re at it let&#39;s jump into World War iii! It&#39;s because they have absolutely no concept of WTF there even talking about it! Just a few weeks ago they couldn&#39;t have spelled Ukraine let alone pointed it out on a map or been able to tell you anything about it! They were told by their leaders this was very important and everything depended on it including what they call democracy! Even though they&#39;re talking about one of the most corrupt authoritarian countries in Europe but they have no idea what that is and also have no idea what war is really like or a concept of how badly everything is screwed up because of their TDS and how much worse they&#39;re actively trying to make it with their little Ukraine Flags in their bios! Sorry to tell you dude literally everyone else wants absolutely nothing to do with this! No one else wants to be anywhere near ukraine! No One Believes we should be there and most believe that the only reason we are is because of how Biden, Pelosi and dozens of others all used Ukraine as their headquarters/corruption playground! Where they had their family members put in positions in companies and organizations that they had no qualifications for business and accept for since the same people overthrew the old Ukrainian government and put in place their own government even choosing a Ukrainian TV actor as the president I guess because of how well actors follow and listen to their directors! The reason why all of these politicians were able to get their family members into these high paying positions in all of these companies without any qualifications wherever even showing up at the job was because these companies used to back the Old Government and now that the new government was in they were terrified they were going to be gotten rid of Etc so they went right to Biden and the rest of them and made deals with them giving them tons of money in order to keep the new puppet government from messing with them! I mean you could ask any of these people if they knew Biden was in charge of Ukraine while he was VP and that he went on National Television laughing and bragging about how he forced to quit Pro quo/blackmail on Ukraine withholding already approved Aid money until they fired what he called that corrupt prosecutor! He said I told them they wouldn&#39;t get the money if they didn&#39;t fire that corrupt prosecutor and they told me I didn&#39;t have the power to do that! I told them to go call the president! They walked out of the room and what the hell do you know a few minutes later they walk back in the room and sure as hell you better believe that prosecutor was fired! Well that prosecutor wasn&#39;t corrupt he was doing his job! It&#39;s just that his job was investigating Biden and his family&#39;s corruption and ukraine! People on the left know none of these things! For god sakes they thought Hunter Biden&#39;s laptop was actually Russian disinformation! All you had to do was look at the damn thing you could see it the whole time it was right there for you to look at and you could have seen the pictures in the emails and everything! Cuz I said they did everything in order to not hear about that! The same as they do it dozens and dozens of other things! It&#39;s absurd they are more interested in who uses what bathrooms then if their actions are going to help to bring about World War 3 or the downfall of the country they live in except they don&#39;t really care about that because they run around burning looting and murdering for months on end screening about how much they hate America and want to see it burn as they wear shirts with hammers and sickles and build Shields to fend off the police with hammers and sickles on that as well! They believe they want their socialist / communist paradise! They believe every form of Communism and all of history as well as up to now wasn&#39;t really communism and this time it&#39;ll be different! They act like they believe the biggest threat America faces is white supremacists to Nazis and that they are ready to jump out from around every corner and out of every dark alley! Everyone used to say how they were just confused and how they didn&#39;t have the information needed in order to understand all of these things! I&#39;m sorry but I could never believe that! One simple thing that Cruise it&#39;s not ignorance but instead malice is that I don&#39;t care who you are there is no one who can act like they wholeheartedly believe something so much and go after / demonize anyone who may think differently then the next day come out and act like no that was never what they said they actually always believe the exact opposite! Really!?! Sorry like I said I don&#39;t care who you are someone can be as dumb as a box of rocks like many of these people are and still there is no way you can say one thing right now and completely do a 180 tomorrow! I&#39;m sorry but that is unacceptable just like it&#39;s unacceptable to call the United States the worst country on the planet and say it is racist and how they want to see it burn to the ground saying how the American, Gadsden, Betsy Ross flags are all signs of extremism and racism!",T3FC7qIAGZk,2022-11-18T10:45:40Z,0.0,0.0,True,False,False,-0.017014179218802505,0.4799369675225841,0

18690,"Regarding one of so many examples like Edward Snowden and our ever-increasing level of mistrust in our Govt:  IF AMERICA still had the awesome JOURNALISTS &amp; MEDIA that we used to have (when journalists knew their primary job was to &quot;keep the bahhrstards honest&quot;) when they knew those who have the power (our government and politicians at any level), we Americans would have so much more trust. <br><br>When our media was relentless in &quot;speaking truth to power&quot;, they kept us very well informed in detail...with getting 2nd &amp; 3rd sources to ensure they got it right.  All politicians, our Govt branches, Governors, Bureaucracies, etc are supposed to be held accountable to the people.  But, just look at the countless number of people that now have YouTube channels, podcasts, Talk Radio, Twitter Accounts, etc - with most of us staying engaged as much as possible to first, get the information as to who&#39;s doing what and secondly, to comment (as I&#39;m doing here) on what we believe or how we feel about it.  <br><br>I&#39;d bet that most people would say we have all these because we now have the internet.  Yes, we&#39;d have a few very informative podcasts and YouTube channels, but nothing...not even close...to the number that now exist.  Primarily because we are SO DIVIDED that half take one point of view and the other half takes the opposing side.  That&#39;s why they are so popular.  Without the media and their non-stop Investigative Journalists keeping us informed with the facts...no matter which political party is involved in a discovered scandal, it has bred an incredible amount of corruption that we&#39;ve never seen before in this country. Of course there was corruption that existed, but with an incredible amount of fear by them to get caught.  The government and politicians used to be almost terrified of our media. It wasn&#39;t an unhealthy level...but it was enough to keep corruption from becoming just about accepted by Americans who now believe it&#39;s inevitable. That POV is by those who were either too young to remember or not even born yet. Like, the number one reason that the CBS program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; was started.  They were constantly working on a story that they&#39;d inevitably get to the bottom of and then air them literally busting corruption; either political (politicians getting payoffs) or in bureaucracy (like an FDA incident where they took their eye off the ball when some beef companies were caught mis-grading subpar beef as Grade AAA beef). <br><br>Now?  Our national news companies no longer have multiple Investigative Journalists on their payroll.  They behave more like TMZ. It&#39;s really pitiful.  If you weren&#39;t around when they took their responsibilities very, very seriously, then you can&#39;t know what it was like.  But, we sure knew how scared to not get caught by the media. They inevitably did.  <br><br>I highly doubt that The Patriot Act would have even been able to be enacted, as the media would&#39;ve hammered home all the dangers to our freedoms. <br>Our media isn&#39;t really &quot;our media&quot;.  I haven&#39;t watched television news for pushing 3 years now. When I witnessed just how our media held only ONE MAN UP ON A PEDESTAL (FAUCI) and 100% pretended that Fauci 100% had our interests as #1 and nobody was allowed to question this new god-like figure any legitimate questions, it was bizarre. The media asked him questions in the daily presser that he was encouraged to give and what he said was repeated over and over by our so-called media as if his answers were gospel.   We now know that more than 1/2 of what he was telling is was such BS.  And the TRUTH to so much of his BS has been found out by people on YouTube...those who have been willing to file for so many emails and other redacted documentation because of the FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) which forces the powers to cough it up.  <br><br>I use the above example about Fauci because it&#39;s so recent, the impact of what he said and didn&#39;t say was so detrimental to us all (due to the level of corruption for $$), and because it&#39;s something that proves just how badly our media failed us all.",T3FC7qIAGZk,2022-11-05T21:44:27Z,0.0,0.0,True,False,False,0.16104157336915959,0.48021520624968905,1

18800,How can this guy say Russia is winning the war in Ukraine? Russia has lost 78 thousand men so far. 1567 were K.I.A. in the last 2 days. One of the largest single day death toll to date in this war. Over 240 planes have been shot down. Over 300 choppers shot down. 5600 A.P.C.(armored personal carrier) have been destroyed! 2500 tanks destroyed. And a month ago Russia became the country with the biggest amount of tanks and weapons and ammo donated to Ukraine because of russian troops running away from the fight or being captured. I watch 5 hours of updates from Russia to the Middle East to the western world about the ongoing &quot;special operation&quot;! The war in Ukraine! This guy doesn&#39;t have the correct information to go on this podcast. Russia is getting their ass handed to them and winter is here and now that Ukraine is armed with western long range artillery and Germany just sent their surface to air toys with a 100% hit rate. Winter is going to be a russian bloodbath with more of their tanks and vehicles getting stuck in the mud due to winter weather. Has this guy not seen the videos of the russian men being handed AK-47 that are falling apart and rusted. How about the fact Russia is using weapons from 70 years ago. For God&#39;s sake Russia was using a machine gun called a Maxum. One of the oldest machine guns built.

The propped up puppets. Soros has been shaping the corruption and destruction of Ukraine since 1989. Whatever Snopes/Open Society aparatchiks states this is false, you need to dig in and understand WHY the entire establishment and world is throwing billions monthly to Ukraine vs Russia. Last I checked, if all the known stooges panics and comes out with their Pro-Ukraine flags is highly suspicious and needs to be looked with a serious dose of scepticism. The entire West has been made a slave to subsidize via taxation the proxy wars the NWO is waging against Putin with the desperation of seriously jeopardized crooks caught in desperation contingency plan.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, I do not consider Putin to be a choir boy, far from it but in this specific instance, I think he is not wrong and simply raised himself to be an enemy on the world stage of the NWO goals.

19357,"I&#39;m a psychologist who conducts assessments of future behavior, mainly selection and risk assessments in occupations where identifying risks is critically important. So I engage in prediciton, and one of the things I do is sniff out frauds. I remain suspicious of Mr. Bustamante. He has an excess of confidence in his predictions not typically seen in those with the deepest level of expertise.  Predicting the future is very hard. Each for their own reasons, ideologues, know-nothings, and con artists often have an air of persuasive certainty about the future. Ideologues see what they want to see. Con artists want you to see what they want you to see, and they know that an air of hyper-confidence fools a lot of people. Know-nothings don&#39;t know how much they don&#39;t know,  so their confidence in their thoughts isn&#39;t tempered by meta-cognition (thinking about their own thinking). Genuine experts tend to hedge more than others when making predictions. They talk more readily about risks, probabilities, ifs, uncertainties, and multiple scenarios.  So Bustamante&#39;s confidence set off alarms in me. He presents as way too confident for an expert. We&#39;ll see, I guess. Winter isn&#39;t here yet a lot can happen.

19417,"Going back and listening to his Ukraine analysis is interesting. Some of it is already leaning towards being wrong. And this is what I hate about listening to &quot;experts&quot; on any one subject because I have learned the bigger the organization the less anyone person will know how things work (at least at the granular level). Gov&#39;t agencies already operate in basically siloed information hubs within office/departments let alone across the entire agency. Regular gov&#39;t agencies work on a need to know basis in any non-classified setting because as a gov&#39;t worker you are not productive if you are listening to a briefing that has nothing to do with your job or department (for that matter most private sector jobs work like that). I won&#39;t pretend to know how classified settings work in gov&#39;t, but I am very familiar with non-classified setting in govt, so cia, fbi, nsa and all the other intelligence agencies are going to silo information even more then regular federal agencies. But, who knows maybe classified information is shared more then non-classified information LOL not being sarcastic at all üòâ. Which, to bring it back to my point is that any single cia, fbi employee, etc is not going to have a comprehensive understanding of every topic discussed and they might not even have a comprehensive understanding of what their own field is because of how large a topic it might be, for example most departments have a whole team dedicated to doing analysis on that topic let alone multiple agents doing the same job. Now, I&#39;m not saying that any single gov&#39;t employee in the CIA or FBI can&#39;t have a operational understanding of how things are done or as we like to say, a 50,000 feet understanding of how things are done. But, the take away is that even people that understand how things are done rely on their employees reports and other departments reports to make their own reports and assessments and every single one of them will still ask questions even if they have been doing the job for 30+ years, so that&#39;s why listening to a single employee that arguably was not that high up in the CIA is not a great temperature gauge of how things are done and take their assessment with a grain of salt as they are probably making wild assumptions about all the parts they were not involved in. And in my experience even people that have worked in any agency for 30+ years still don&#39;t know basic questions to things that they sometimes work on. I mean, think about it the amount of information is always going to be too much to remember over any long period of time especially 30 yrs.

19545,"Secrets, review the panel report by Patrick j Moynihan on secrecy in government, and how it allows the Democratic principles to be eaten away at the inside. As sunlight is the only roach powder. That works. And the reason the years look so long, is it is an attempt to span the multiple generations that are required to protect those that can be wounded hurt or killed, by that information exposure. Knowing that who talks to whom when is enough to draw a circle around an area, and then kill all within to let their highest being sort it out. Sometimes dipping them in tar and hanging them on a fence underneath the sign that says this is what happens to those who help the great Satan.Which has happened. off and with the mother often trying to jump in to save her child Sadly we have enough hubris to assume that no other agency is as clever as ours. Or effective as ours. And when we are disappointed in ourselves. We don&#39;t review all of the documents to see if the secrets that other have discovered and disclosed to themselves or something that the American people deserve to know. Even if it&#39;s uncomfortable and would force not only a political reaction but an executive reaction. But as in generalnemesis follows  hubris  . Plus we forget our feet of clay. Where the typical Greek tragedy is repeated. Those things we do to ourselves knowing what the result will be.  Sleeping with your mother eh? this will not end well.  w,here the first obligation of having a spy in your office or a data spill is to confess it to those who know how to protect our friends, and have access to all that is needed to do that. Where it&#39;s entirely foolish to say I talked to the classifying authority and told them. So as not to be politically embarrassed. Or stay trying to stay within the rules of you need not disclose personal information kinda, like wedding pictures. So we&#39;ll print it all out have my lawyer sort through it and then hand those pages back to those who know how to clean up and wish them luck after months have passed and they&#39;ve already been dipped into her which if you&#39;ve ever seen videos of. People with their hands tied behind their back being lowered into tar. Bend horribly to try to keep their front parts out of the tar. since those that are semi responsible for the spill they certainly know that they can walk across the street and go sit in the prioruses office entry. And when she walks in she will see her, and wave her into her office. And say what is it child? Where she takes on the role of a mother confessor. Head in hands And all they do is speak the truth to each other. And how certain she is about how terrible the political damage to her will be once this is still is exposed and investigated and disclosed. Because she has an affirmative action to deliver the best and most searchable content to those who clean up after a data spill or spy Then she brings into her office calls into her office one of her most able clerks. And says you will act for me with my full authority to protect this woman in every single way and as soon as you run into any difficulty it come see me. And I will address it myself. which is why those that have been approved by the senate like a title three judge being the best or one of the supreme Court justices as well.or elected have this very privilege in order to enable whistleblowers to exist. There is no individual that has a higher security clearance than those who have been elected as our representatives, or approved by the Senate. Though they are denied the personal privilege to declassify anything. Which is how the system has to work to enable truth up and down the stack. And for the same reasons if a elected official asks you as a government employee a question. You must answer or convince them they don&#39;t want to ask the question. And the most you can ask for is give me an hour or two and I&#39;ll get my boss&#39;s boss on the phone with you to attempt the same and if you still ask the question I will answer.

Also, the way the US instigated Russia to attack Ukraine by loading their border with missiles, as well as operating biological weapons laboratories within the country, seems an AWFUL LOT like what the Nazis would do, does it not?  We can make the argument &quot;but they&#39;re so dangerous we had to do it&quot; - but that&#39;s bullshit, because we made numerous moves over the course of YEARS to cripple Russia - this is a location of strategic importance to them, and they can&#39;t risk their vital ports near that border as the most powerful nation in the world puts all manner of weapons, even those supposedly banned by treaties, on said border.<br><br>I am not a huge fan of Russia, by the way, nor am I a fan of Ukraine.  Both are infamously corrupt, and that&#39;s not to slight the people of either country because I know good people from both - but these power games are not &quot;the people&quot; - and they&#39;re not just Putin, either.  The US is the driving force behind so much of this, and we taxpayers are the ones who will foot the bill, whether it be monetary, resources, or lives.  We foot the bill right there along with those two countries, and it&#39;s all because our warmongering politicians CAN&#39;T abide by agreements, treaties, etc that they&#39;ve made and agreed upon, because people in the war business have them bought and paid for and that&#39;s an indisputable fact - both Republicans AND Democrats do - and it&#39;s a sure bet if you see them gung-ho about the war and trying to give it a veneer of righteousness or puking up the same old sanctimony, you will find a politician with arms manufacturers or private security firm special interests.  <br><br>It&#39;s easy to make all this sound one-sided, like Russia is just evil and the aggressor, but that is obviously never going to be the case in this reality we exist within.  It never has been.  Anyone who still thinks the United States are just some force for justice needs to consider, the same government sending Ukraine weapons and money, in the many billions of dollars (that we know about), are trying to disarm THEM at home, and nullify their constitutional rights.   One shouldn&#39;t need to be a fan of guns to see the glaring problem this presents, and it exposes their true nature like nothing else could.  They&#39;re dirty and corrupt, and our lives mean nothing to them, and the sooner everyone realizes this the more of a chance we might have to stem the tide of WWIII and our extinction. <br><br>...if you ask me, there&#39;s also the Russian Orthodox Catholic church, whose structure is fundamentally opposed to authoritarianism and centralization - this, given the nature of faith, is a very serious problem to globalism and the US government - who only PRETEND to be populist in any way - they obviously aren&#39;t and that can be seen overseas AND here at home.   Look at how they attack the church in America, when the Roman Catholic church is FAR more compatible to these ideals - it&#39;s still under attack, because belief / faith in anything other than government is an historical problem to such systems - a HUGE one tat that.  That&#39;s why they&#39;ve always had such a hard-on for Russia.  I am not standing up for Russia, either, as I said, but these things CANNOT go unacknowledged if we want to understand the situation and insist on instigating these conflicts... the US people might largely oppose such maneuvers, but they don&#39;t make the decisions - woke assholes do, woke assholes with no regard for our lives - or human life in general, and unless they face SERIOUS opposition at home while we still have the RIGHT to oppose them, we will lose all of it, and we may even see a &quot;reset&quot; of civilization as a whole, and I&#39;m not just talking about &quot;The Great Reset&quot; - I&#39;m referring to nuclear conflict, however likely or unlikely one believes it is - it&#39;s a definite possibility, and many of our decision makers are also advocates of population control and communism - it&#39;s not a coincidence.  <br><br>...I guess I&#39;ll just end this there for now...",T3FC7qIAGZk,2022-08-24T08:29:51Z,1.0,0.0,True,False,False,0.02290100250626567,0.5558096630465053,1

Maybe that‚Äôs a good thing, but democracy is an ideal worth spreading (in my opinion).<br><br>But Bustamante‚Äôs portrayal of what happened in Hong Kong as evidence for this point is off the mark. Yes, the Chinese government (under the guise of Hong Kong police) did beat, kill, and detain protesters. But anybody who was witness to those protests knows how disruptive they were to the normal functioning of Hong Kong. Protesters uprooted bricks from the sidewalk and broke street railings to use as barriers against riot police. If this same thing happened in the US (like it has), people wouldn‚Äôt be outraged when riot police detained or beat protesters.  So what happened in Hong Kong wasn‚Äôt uncharacteristic to how any democratic countries‚Äôs police force would respond to a large protest. <br><br>Also, Bustamante suggests that Hong Kong and Ukraine are equivalent, but since the 1997 handover, the US and Britain have recognized that Hong Kong is a part of China. Ukraine is different though. The US recognizes Ukraine as being an independent nation.

21198,"The hypocrisy and propaganda coming from this guy is astounding. We should demonize Snowden for breaking the law, but when government breaks the law or is just generally immoral, it&#39;s supposed to be ignored, accepted, and overlooked!!?? <br><br>This guy is clearly brilliant, fascinating to listen to, and makes a lot of very good points. But he focuses purely on the bright side of government and institutions while minimizing the shadow.  And the way he promotes so faithfully the righteousness of U.S. institutions but finds it so easy to decry the evils of every other country is a silly, dated, and tired way of viewing the world.  News flash homie, there is often a massive disparity between legality and morality. Just because you want to believe your shit doesn&#39;t stink doesn&#39;t make that the truth.<br><br>Don&#39;t fall for the lie that secrets and yielding unaccountable power to these secret institutions (which by the way always end up taking on a life of their own) somehow makes us safer.  Yielding and outsourcing your ability to defend yourself to an outside entity never makes you safer. You don&#39;t make society safer by collectively weakening all of it&#39;s individuals. Secrets in themselves are a massive affront to our dignity. Knowledge is power.  So by keeping us out of the know all they are doing is disempowering us.  Governments and TPTB justify this by creating false enemies, perpetual warfare, an ever looming threat which we have to be protected from. they keep us in fear and barrage us with false flag attacks and fake news. They will find an easy target with something they can steal and scapegoat them (WMDs in Iraq anyone?). You will often find in war that both sides are funded by the same source. Hmm I wonder why?  They claim the secrets are for our own good and insinuate  that we are too immature and stupid to handle information and truth, and unable to make decisions for ourselves.  They keep us in a constant state of stress and alertness through one made up, manufactured crisis after another.  They disempower us and insult us, and essentially treat us like children.  They foster dependence and weakness in us so they can play the strongman savior and claim legitimacy. <br><br>I feel like even if you were to confront this guy with hard evidence of false flag operations which result in citizens being sacrificed and murdered, this guy would have no problem defending the actions and would do whatever mental gymnastics it takes to keep pretending his team is the good guy.  Torture? Murder? Sure why not.  But why stop there? How bout some good old fashion child sex trafficking-- that should be useful. There&#39;s clearly no moral boundaries these fkers won&#39;t cross. His insane stance defending the supposed goodness and dependability of our largely unaccountable government and it&#39;s secret organizations, and his concept that these institutions are here to serve the people, are laughable.  Naivete at best but dangerous falsehood nontheless.  Even if such sacrifices were done in the name of the greater good, are you comfortable with that? Our gracious overlords, watching over us, playing God and deciding who gets sacrificed, who lives and who dies? Choosing what information we are privy to? Utterly censoring and dominating the flow of our collective narratives? They have taken God like powers of control over us, our lives and the lives of our descendants.  Fk that. The fact that false flags and the murder of citizens is even discussed as a potential option at the highest levels of government is an egregious outrage. It&#39;s so obvious that these institutions don&#39;t give a shit about us and will sacrifice us in a heartbeat.  It&#39;s almost like he is a reverse conspiracy theorist, if that makes sense. He subscribes to whatever naive nonsense he has to in order to maintain his worldviews. <br><br>It&#39;s straight cognitive dissonance, ignoring the massive corruptions and shadows of our institutions and the absolute trampling of our constitution.  He&#39;s pushing straight propaganda, and he&#39;s great at it.  This same type of one sided, black and white  thinking is why the world is so fked up. CONSUME.  OBEY. Eat your poison and consume your daily pornography and soma (happy pills) to get you through the bleakness of it all. Eat your garbage scraps like a dog and be happy. Be a good little blind sheep and pay no attention to the evils of late stage capitalism, the general erosion overtime of freedoms and liberties in this country, our slow entropic descent into turning into a banana republic, the massive psychological bombardment of the mainstream media to control our minds and shape our realities; the censorship and rigid monetary control of what gets funded, researched,  patented, and made public in the sectors of science, tech, medicine, education, etc; election meddling and rigging here and abroad; and the countless other indignities, inequalities, injustices, and widescale suffering that the status quo perpetuates. Drug peddling life ruining substances to poor, inner city black folks.  Even the murder of American citizens. The overthrow of multitudes of legitimately elected governments/government officials in other countries. The CIA has it&#39;s hand in all of these. Fact not conspiracy.<br><br>We will never integrate our shadow and heal our world until we have the balls to stare into the dark abyss of our souls and bring light to it. Here&#39;s an idea. Instead of allowing a handful of individuals to take all the world&#39;s wealth and resources, to monopolize media and every other public institution, how about we start questioning how to make the world a better place for all? Human life is so cheap to tptb. The only thing they care about is power and the vast majority of us are expected to silently and obediently put up with it.  <br><br>Viewing the world as some sort of geopolitical zero sum game is a sickness we need to collectively grow up and evolve away from. Secret organizations need to go. For profit prisons and slavery need to go.  Monopolies and centralized power needs to be broken up. Money needs to be removed from politics entirely. The endless lobbying and insider trading, the abuse of political power for personal gain needs to end. Government service should be absolutely transparent, to an extreme degree.  We need to rebuild our middle class. The poisoning of our minds, our bodies, our world environments, our water, our food needs to end. Fiat currency? The entire debt based monetary system? What a fkin joke. And the sacrifice of young people and so called foreign enemies through war to rape, colonize, and economically bully other countries in the interest of maintaining global hegemony for psychopathic neoliberalist elites needs to end. <br><br>Human life should be supremely valued, not money and power.  We should be unified, not allowing ourselves to be constantly divided and polarized, scapegoating and hating &quot;them&quot;. Education and life enriching values should be prioritized and funded. Mother nature needs to be valued and treated with respect. The oneness of all life needs to be appreciated. Not weapons, tools of oppression, and mass surveillance.  <br><br>This guy needs to wake up and realize that in many ways, the secret organizations, the justice department, the DEA, the media, propaganda machines, dogmatic world religions, etc are weaponized tools the matrix is using to keep poor people, the vast majority of humanity, oppressed. He wants to run around playing army man, cops and robbers, and blaming foreign threats or focusing on smaller domestic threats. But what he fails to realize is that the majority of the time the real threats to our security aren&#39;t external. The real threats to human life as a whole are always closest to home. The real threats are those that will tell you lies to make you feel insecure and defenseless and then tell you that they have the solutions.  But we have to trust them, blindly.  Like we&#39;re in some sort of religious cult.  The real threats are those that disempower us, use us as if we are a commodity, treat us like dumb animals, tax us to death, and put their boots into our necks daily.<br><br>The way he so easily discredits &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; is wildly insulting.  Yes-- over time, power and money centralizes.  It&#39;s human nature, not a fkin conspiracy.  Just because some people think differently and see patterns or focus on oddities and irregularities that he so easily writes off as unimportant does not mean they are wrong or undeserving of attention.  When you trace the money and use a bit of logic...when you continuously ask why...who benefits?  Basic concepts. When you constantly see smoke there is bound to be a fire.  And MSM is almost entirely suspicious bullshit.  The hilariously appalling, weak, and crumbling narrative portrayed by the MSM is mind-breakingly absurd.<br><br>Are we not tired yet of being programmed by others? Are we going to be  happy as cold, emotionless, robotic puppets? machine men with machine hearts? Will we ever grow tired  of trading our souls and being confined to to the tiny boxes this world keeps us in?<br><br>While I partially agree with much of what he says, his narrative and general worldview is full of bullshit, logical fallacies, and half truths and I resent that. He&#39;s lying to himself and more importantly he&#39;s lying to all of us.<br><br>Human beings are essentially divine creatures at our core with God like potential and every single one of us should be treated as such.  Humanity can emerge from it&#39;s present servitude and the darkness reigning over this world but we have to do it together. There is no limit to what we are capable of but we need to end this false us versus them paradigm and depart from the idol worship of money.  We need to stop forfeiting our power to the nearest psychopathic mafioso willing to play on our emotions and insecurities and fears.  We need to stand up and demand what is right and not just go along with what is easiest or  what is immediately gratifying.",T3FC7qIAGZk,2022-08-18T05:57:37Z,0.0,0.0,True,False,False,0.021733326371484275,0.5369978186206255,1

Russia doesn&#39;t have the numbers to continue the war for much longer - and winter will hit the troops in the field much harder than it will hit European nations. Russian troops particularly, as they are v poorly equipped. Also - lifting sanctions on Russia won&#39;t necessarily mean Russia decides to start pumping gas again. And Russia winning doesn&#39;t mean sanctions will be lifted. Winter will just be HIMARS long range destruction party, because there will be fewer Russian ground assaults.

21773,"After watching the full podcast and sitting with it for a moment these are the things that really stood out to me as blatant red flags. <br><br><br>1. He said the reason he left the CIA was because he wanted to have a family, but then goes on to say he‚Äôs going to ship his kid off to an international school as soon as he is old enough??? <br><br>2. That the CIA intentionally recruits people without morals <br><br>3. That he relates and is friends with criminals, he obviously connects with people who are manipulative and sociopathic in nature. <br><br><br>4. That when he puts himself in other peoples perspective he does not feel empathy for them. I think Lex was correct in associating the practice of using perspective and putting yourself in another‚Äôs worldview as a naturally empathetic practice, in doing it you should naturally feel what they are feeling if you are in touch with your emotions. For me and I believe most people the practice of seeing through the eyes of another is a empathetic process associated with a full spectrum of feelings. The fact that Andrew Bustamante does this without feeling is sociopathic in nature.  He sees it only as a tool for manipulation. Lex has a much more developed understanding of this process and the true power of its ability to connect and unify us, he is not interested in controlling others. Andrew has been conditioned from years in the military to be able to compartmentalize his emotions from his decision making process. People in touch with their emotions don‚Äôt ship their kid off to bordering school.. <br><br>5. Parents aren‚Äôt welcome in the CIA. This is dangerous in so many ways. I understand that families create targets and it is dangerous but not having family changes your worldview. Having children helps you understand your connection to life beyond yourself, it is a humbling and enlightening experience for most people. We are social beings, Like he said we crave community and if your totally cut off from any (like most Americans) and probably anyone in the CIA  you become very vulnerable to whatever organization you serve. Especially if they are the only ones who know your real identity. He seems very forgiving and nonchalant about the endless list of human rights violations by the CIA. He is obviously attached to the community and identity of the organization. He‚Äôs literally building his career off of The image and trying to whitewash its atrocities.<br><br>6. He thinks it‚Äôs ok for the CIA to break the law and commit human rights violations if it‚Äôs in defense of national security.. having a government breaking our constitutional rights does not make us more secure. The domestic threats we face here are far greater than any foreign. The people in power here have a much more direct impact on our lives. <br><br>6. When asked to give his opinion he said he always try‚Äôs to avoid giving his opinion, instead he shares what he calls his assessment. And then he went on to share his ‚Äòopinion‚Äô but put it in an objective context. In other words he has convinced himself that his opinion is the objective truth, because he bases it on what he believes are objective facts. This stems back to when he said he would debate his step father about objective reality as a teenager. He obviously has a metaphysical and philosophical interest, and like him I believe in the objective world as well. But it exist in a paradox, we can only ever grasp it through a subjective lens and as such the interpretation can never be assumed as 100% accurate. That breeds arrogance and denial in the face of counter arguments. Opens you up to much more cognitive dissonance. This is why Lex is such a brilliant man. He has the ability to stay skeptical and open minded even after obtaining so much information about the world and himself, the true sign of intellectual genius üëå<br><br>Overall I found Andrew to be a brilliant and well spoken individual.

21910,"Whoa, whoa, whoa.   Not the 9-11 scandal.  You don&#39;t get to ascribe to incompetence that which is clearly malevolence.  I know you guys love throwing out the Occam&#39;s Razor line, to lend credence to whatever you say, because most people don&#39;t know what that is, and it sounds all science-y, so we&#39;re all supposed to fall in line and believe whatever you say after that, but I do know what it means, and I do Not buy whatever else you say after.  It just means the simplest explanation is probably the right answer.  Also, There is No &quot;MUST&quot; in the phrase that &#39;one should try not to Ascribe to malevolence that which can be ascribed to incompetence&#39;.   I&#39;ll grant you there was an incomprehensible lack of competence that day, but there has been nothing but coverups and overt malevolence ever since.    The Pentagon surely has more than One single camera on their compound, yet they will only release the Edited film from the one camera on site that is blocked by gas tanks, thus preventing anyone from seeing the actual crash into the building.   <br><br> Hmmmm.   Incompetence?   I think not.   Much like the current refusal to release all the video of the Jan 6 &quot;insurrection&quot;, there seems to be absolutely no good reason Not to let us see ALL of what they have, and yet, they dole out snippets of videos that THEY alone choose to allow us lowly peons to see. All other video is locked away, or destroyed (or &quot;lost&quot;).  You don&#39;t get to have it both ways.  Either these agencies are all incompetent, in which case, there&#39;s no reason fore EVERYONE to cover up, or they&#39;re covering up their actions because there&#39;s too much corruption and malevolence. <br><br>People get it when mistakes are made.  What they don&#39;t get, is cover ups.  Covering up, means you did something wrong, and fear the repercussions.  Mistakes mean you get fired, at worst, and anyone who didn&#39;t make the mistakes would have no reason to cover up your idiocy.  Let&#39;s not assume that an entire government would go so far out of their way to cover up the actions of 1, or a few, idiots who make a bad mistake.  No, the coverups aren&#39;t proof of embarrassment, they&#39;re proof of criminal wrongdoing on the part of someone powerful, who does not want to accept the consequences.

I think it needs to be clear, that this must be talking (mostly) about Citizens born in the People&#39;s Republic of China, mainland China, especially in the last 40-50 years. Which is a sizeable number of people, 800 million or so. But there are Chinese Americans in California for example, whose family been there since the 1850s, 1880s... In Malaysia and Singapore, many Chinese people whose families been there since the 1800s and early 1900s also. Even immigrants who moved out even more recently, 70s, 80s, 90s, may have cut all ties. In many countries around the world who have generations of connection with new lands they live in and no to little connection to CCP China. As well as the Taiwanese, Hong Kongers... Macau, whose families been there for generations who nominally in the shadow on the CCP, sure, but not under total control. Sure there probably is a small fraction of those long disconnected from the mainland, Chinese people abroad, that are loyal and fans of the CCP somehow. But by far, that can&#39;t be the case. As their families left China during the turbulent dying days of the Qing Dynasty, or during the early 1900s revolution and Republic of China years, or during the Civil War or WW2, or maybe even after the communist revolution or in the 1960s and 1970s. Maybe even before that. The first Chinese to move to Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Italy.. some other places was in the 1400-1500s That is probably 50 million Chinese people, at least, or more around the world.

21933,"Respectfully, Mr Bustamante, I enjoyed a lot of what you had to say, right up til you gave us all the lecture about not worrying about the Government getting out of control in going after their political opponents.   Saying that the Government leaders, the FBI, the Police, the Judges, and all the other people who stand between regular citizens and our Fearless Leaders, would put an abrupt end to such illegal activities seems at best na√Øve, and at worst propaganda. <br><br>Nobody in their right mind could be watching the activities of these last few years by our &quot;leaders&quot; against the citizens, and their elected representatives (Trump, et al), and still believe this could never happen here.   The courts are More than happy to sign off on out of control FBI Raids of any number of innocent people who had the wrong politics, ruining their lives, destroying their finances, and throwing them in jail for crimes no one has ever gone to jail for in the past - despite members of the opposite party having committed wildly more egregious crimes of a similar nature, without any attempt to even investigate them - much less arrest, or prosecute them. <br><br>It seems unlikely to me that a person who worked within the CIA for any amount of time would be likely to be that naive, so that kinda puts you in the propaganda department.  It&#39;s too bad, because I think that a lot of good people start work for the Government agencies, thinking they&#39;re doing good, eventually becoming seduced into believing the agency they work for is all good, and never bad, no matter what they do.  I know, I&#39;ve heard the same words you&#39;re saying, from others who work for big 3-initial government agencies, too.  <br><br>They&#39;re not dumb, they just drink the Kool-aid every morning, and can&#39;t fathom how anyone out in the real world could see anything but goodness in their actions - agency wide.  The leaders get caught lying - well, they Had to lie.   The leaders get caught conspiring to take down a duly elected President - well, someone had to - we know he&#39;s bad for the country.  The FBI Foments a riot in DC, well someone needs to pay for that, so arrest Granny!  And that guy with the horns, too!  Teach those evil seditionists a lesson!<br><br>All the while, the FBI, CIA, NSA, and every other alphabet agency spends all their time chasing after imaginary terrorist Nazi&#39;s (ie, Republicans) within the US, and nobody gives crap about any of the real threats to the US.

How do their children all become foreign investment gurus, all working for US Enemies, just when Mom or Dad have some sway over US foreign policy?  (Nancy P, Joe B, J Kerry, just to name a few proud parents of foreign &quot;investment&quot; managers). <br><br>Let me know how you feel about that, then get back to me about how we&#39;re all so silly to think there&#39;s something fishy going on, and we&#39;d be wise to take note of who&#39;s watching who, and what&#39;s happening to the watched, as they find themselves in their jammies on the front lawn with 30 FBI agents - weapons drawn, and CNN filming. <br><br>One time, sure, somebody got out over their skis.

That said,  when people talk about UFOs,  I always think of the Irish and their fairies.  I&#39;ve actually experienced BOTH:  the energy of fairies and  UFO&#39;s and it is REAL.  IT does NOT take the form of matter except maybe in a nanosecond outta the corner of yourüëÅ eye.  YOU THINK you saw it but are NEVER sure but you KNOW you felt it.  Fairies were famous in the Irish Folklore for kidnapping little children and little babies and stories about UFOs say the same tho it&#39;s usually adults, not babies. They don&#39;t interact with you on your plane in your world but they take you to their world and  they interact on THEIR plane in THEIR world with you. <br>         THANKS for your question about Epstein because I kept trying to explain to people why he had hundreds of cameras everywhere and there were thousands of photos that all disappeared upon his murder in that prison.  The explanation given by your guest explains to me why Maxwell is now in a prison where she has daily massages &amp;  access to swimming pools and she&#39;s living a better life than I am in a teeny town in Central Texas where I do NOT have daily  massages (because they aren&#39;t affordable) and there are NO pools except in the summer.  So I envy her-- in a sense-- her prison life which was definitely upgraded because she actually was part of a  government secret service operation where  her evil involvement in seducing children( not grown ass women as your guest said)was ignored. <br>        Regarding the CIA involvement with  drugs,  your guest misspoke.  ALL you have to do is google  Nicaragua and drugs &amp;  what happened in the inner cities where African Americans lived. They sold coke to the blacks and took the money to fund their operation in Central America.  THAT has been documented and known about for decades and I&#39;m surprised that he gave you disinformation on a known fact.<br>        He also misspoke regarding 911 by creating a self-affirming cognitive Loop which denied the collapse-- which was actually the blowing up-- of the third building. Any engineer or workman doing demolition of buildings  can tell you that the last building down was destroyed  from within and we all know that no plane hit it and yet it fell down. Funny thingüôÑ Of course, maybe it was OPERATION UFO/FAIRIE: an invisible energy force takes down a buildingüôÉ?<br>The official explanation was upside down and inside out.   THAT building was set up to photograph the other two buildings and it contains all sorts of secret information collected over a long period of time as well as of course the footage of the other two buildings being hit by planes and collapsing. ALL info stored in the 3rd building gone in the ensuing fires.  The powers that be did NOT want that info to get out and so the building was destroyed and yes you are correct it wasn&#39;t the Saudis that made that decision and executed it. Your guest is RIGHT: begin with truth (ie plane hits two buildings) &amp; end with falsehood, counting on the self affirming cognitive loop to tie up loose strings.<br>      I think Lex you conducted yourself well but as many people have said and actually your guest said indirectly,  he is STILL working for the CIA BUT in a different position and presenting himself in a different manner BUT once an agent always an agent.  YOU can see they did not let him go because he was a valued asset and they simply gave him a job he could conduct while  maintaining his close ties with his family.",T3FC7qIAGZk,2022-08-14T20:52:07Z,0.0,0.0,True,False,False,0.007860195360195358,0.39488838456229775,1

22196,"When talking about UFO and aliens, unfortunately the narrative is still very distorted and, despite some attempts for disclosure at various levels, people is still not offered an overview of the phenomenon, including the &quot;Who are they?&quot; and &quot;Why are they here?&quot;. Here is some attempt of an overview. I hope that some of it opens your and your reader&#39;s mind a little bit to the realm of possibilities. By the way, this is based on 40 years of countless personal experiences and research by an aerospace engineer and PhD, working on space vehicle re-entry technology (among other things...) since 20 years and also trained into spiritual/esoteric practices as well. More recently, I have also being involved in neuroscientific meditation experiments, providing some interesting insights. So, let‚Äôs go a little deeper. There are multiple interdimensional beings interfering with human matters, some are coming from different timelines and/or dimensions,  planets/star systems/galaxies/universes, Inner Earth. Some are malevolent (e.g. Draco-reptoids, negatively polarized Orion beings, Spiders, black Dragons, gargoyles and demonic spirits), have established and controlled the world agenda for millennia, they vampirise people energetically (they literally feed off negative human emotions like fear, anger, depression and are interested in sucking up our souls like Tom mentioned) and are currently pursuing the trans-humanistic agenda via AI and nanotechnologies. They rely on manipulation of information and mind control (from the physical and astral planes) in order to manipulate our free will in order to follow their agenda. Then, there are benevolent beings (e.g. angels, spirits of ascended masters, golden Dragons, councils of light, intergalactic Confederation, Arcturians, Pleiadians, Sirians, Lyrans, Andromedans, Antareans, Golden beings from the Central Sun, positively polarized Orion beings) for whom we are like little brothers who need to learn lessons. They don‚Äôt violate our free will and try to assist human evolution, helping both technological and spiritual progress without being intrusive. Moreover, there are millions of higher-dimensional beings who are incarnated on this planet as humans to help the ongoing shift of consciousness: some called them starseeds or wanderers. In particular, both Native American tribes, Revelation book and Sanskrit tradition talk about 144,000 rainbow warriors or angels, referring to the core group of these souls. We don&#39;t need to wait for the gov to reveal anything. We can communicate with benevolent &quot;ET&quot; beings through hypnosis, meditation, lucid dreams. I have been organizing stargate meditations for this purpose and a few thousands people worldwide have tried them already with various degrees of success, as testified on my channel. These meditations have also been tested with EEG on 11 volunteers within a neuroscientific study at the Institute of Noetic Sciences, showing a considerable effect on the brain activity in all wave ranges,  from delta to gamma, depending on the subject. Unlike CE5, they don&#39;t require a specific protocol. Psychedelics can be effective as well but can be dangerous: when people rely upon drug-induced altered states, negative astral entities (it is crowded out there‚Ä¶) can more easily infiltrate their auric field with unwanted consequences (all the way up to depression, schizophrenia, suicidal thoughts, emotional imbalance, etc.).  When seeking contacts, there are ways of protecting against infiltration/psychic attacks from negative entities with visualization, crystals, prayers, shamanic practices, sounds at certain frequencies. The key for contacting benevolent beings is to be in a positive emotional state: we function like antennas and attract not only fellow humans but also other entities resonating at the frequency we vibrate. Contact with positively oriented higher-dimensional beings under meditation or hypnosis can result in powerful experiences, including kundalini awakening, emotional or physical healings, sense of bliss, feeling strong energies/vibrations especially localized in/around the chakras, having powerful visuals of other beings/worlds, out-of-body experiences, etc. Messages from benevolent beings typically focus on unconditional love, unity, bliss, respect for Mother Earth and service to others, while negative beings play on our ego-mind and push us towards a self-serving or even self-destructive agenda.",T3FC7qIAGZk,2022-08-14T11:08:39Z,0.0,2.0,True,False,False,0.03093844287026106,0.48348747212383564,1

Then Russia will loose more money. Europe is unite and have ability to not use Russian resources. It&#39;s expensive as hell, but people won&#39;t freeze in their homes.<br><br>In recent years there was repercussion from 2007 financial crisis and COVID.

22228,"Lex&#39;s uncontested comment about Russian soldiers &quot;shooting at civilians&quot; epitomises the lack of reality and information that this commentary is unfortunately built on - the reason why Russian progress is so slow is because there&#39;s a priority to avoid civilian casualties and Ukraine utilises this policy by placing military in the midst of civilian areas and structures. It&#39;s pretty obvious when considering there&#39;s no mass bombing by the Russian air force unlike the &#39;shock and awe&#39; of the US attacks on Iraq Libya Serbia etc. Anyone who talks of the Russians &#39;shooting at civilians&#39; is consuming only the propaganda of Ukraine .... look at the lies of Bucha, Snake Island, Ghost of Kiev and the multitude of absurd Ukrainian allegations that Russia is shelling areas already under its control( to divert from  Ukraine&#39;s obvious war crimes) That&#39;s not to say there aren&#39;t war crimes on both sides. One thing  this guest does get right is that this is a proxy war.... but anyone who thinks Russia attempted to capture Kiev ( instead of that aspect being the obvious &#39;shaping of the battlefield&#39; as articulated by Scott Ritter in the first week) just doesn&#39;t understand this war. Lex would have informed himself properly had he examined analysis of dedicated geopolitical channels like The Duran or Gonzalo Lira who was trapped in Kharkov when the invasion began and provides honest analysis despite having witnessed the SBU &#39;disappear&#39; so many analysts in Ukraine who told the truth about this corrupt one party state (no political or media critiscism allowed in Ukraine) <br>Quite disappointing that Lex simply accepts the Western narrative of this war and doesn&#39;t know this war started in 2014 with the coup and Western disregard for the Minsk agreements and of course Putin&#39;s final attempts to avoid this tragedy in Russia&#39;s security proposals of 2021 which were sidestepped by the US and flat out ignored by NATO. An end to the war was negotiated in Turkey but BoJo and Biden&#39;s Admin wouldn&#39;t ok the agreement which would have avoided the deaths of around 120 thousand under equipped Ukrainian conscripts who aren&#39;t allowed to surrender - the  &#39;anti-retreat&#39; units of the SBU are right behind Ukrainian lines making an example of every unfortunate Ukrainian( they catch) who tries to escape death in this meat grinder by surrendering, defecting or running away from a war Ukraine cannot possibly win.

As of July, the UN reported that 90% of the buildings in the city are destroyed. <br>His representation of the outlook for energy supplies for winter in Europe is also exaggerated. Europe is adapting. Norway upped NG supplies. Europe is setting up LNG access and seeking alternatives for heat.

Russia needs to be held accountable for this war and the 1m+ forcibly deported Ukrainians need to be returned.

22674,"I didnt realize how completely clueless Lex is about this issue. For instance, Ukraine is as far from a democracy as North Korea. One party allowed, the right sector. The other parties were banned  and their leaders thrown in jail. All non completely state controlled media has been banned and the amount of indoctrination pushed is at the level of North Korea or perhaps even worse. <br>Denying the Nazi element is denying reality and history, do most people only have a memory span of 4-5 years?  You can read articles from all major newspapers, The Guardian, New York Times, BBC etc which all describe the problem with not just Nazi divisions included in the regular army like Azov but also infiltration on key government positions. The most extreme elements that only a idiot would deny are Nazis are a minority though, with only a few percent of the people&#39;s support. But since Ukraine is one of the most corrupt countries on earth, it doesnt matter that much. For instance, Zelensky was hand picked to be the president long before the &quot;election&quot;. He was chosen because he threatened no one of the oligarchs with real power. Thats why he started playing in a TV series actually playing the President of Ukraine and in fiction fought government corruption. The TV series was funded by the same person who funded Zelenskiy career. An oligarch with triple citizenship&#39;s called Kolomoisky. <br>Im impressed with the guest&#39;s honesty due to his history, usually its older former CIA employees that can be really honest and gives the same view but without the sugarcoating Andrew is providing. For instance, Putin is a moderate and a former lawyer in the former KGB. He does everything by the book and doesnt bluff. If he disappeared, the chances are 100% that someone much more aggressive would take his place and someone without Putin&#39;s enormous patience and willingness to put his people over all other interests.  Thats the whole reason for this military operation, he waited for 8 years for Ukraine to comply with the Minsk agreement. Instead, they continued with the civil war and genocide, which began in 2014 when the elected government was overthrown in a coup called Euromaidan. Resulting in, 14000 dead civilians in Donbass where the vast majority were ethnic Russians. Many factors, including increased and much heavier shelling from Ukraine on major population centers in the east of Ukraine (Donbass), mostly suppressed from MSM. Another area where Lex is completely clueless of how controlled the media is in the West, going by experts and former CIA employees the media in Russia is much less government controlled. And it seems pretty evident due to the fact that about 90% of the reporting done on the war is disinformation and propaganda. Many good and independent journalists are feeling the pressure and are getting banned from Twitter and demonetized from YouTube due to the relentless groups based in Ukraine doing mass reporting and all kinds of trick to silence American citizens. Who exposes truths that are not in favor of Ukraine, like the many war crimes and atrocities they commit. Only a stupid person would believe that all the Gypsies they cellophane-wrap around light posts and are beating is the result of them punishing thieves. Thats a stereotype, and what they are actually doing is humiliating people they see as sub human. Thats not my opinion, there are several good journalists in Ukraine on the Russian side, far less on the Ukraine side and when they come home. They are not even allowed to report what they have experienced and seen with their own yes. There are many examples, too many to disregard it. One is a French male journalist who made a long interview talking about his experiences, another a female who rebelled and refused to read the propaganda narrative given to her in a live TV event. Ukraine have also pushed many false flags in order to &quot;win&quot; the information war.

22744,"Andrew is arguing for a CIA director promoted to the position by whom? The intelligence community itself? If so, this is even more problematic than the &quot;cronyism&quot; of the president selecting CIA director. At least through representative government the election of the president makes the appointment tenuously attached to a democratic process. If they are appointed internally, just by &quot;merit&quot; the danger for cronyism is even more present as it will be much less of a transparent process orchestrated by unelected members of the government. The legislative branch would be the most democratic appointers of the position but I doubt the intelligence community would champion this option either as they will have even less control over the process and would likely argue that the legislature will also distort meritocratic appointment with their political biases. If the presidential appointment is a flawed process, I won&#39;t argue but based on the structure of the government who would you rather empower to make the appointment? The CIA already operates much like the Fed. If we did away with the vestiges of a democratic process in the appointment of the director by the executive, it would simply be an unaccountable, autonomous government within our government - which it basically is at present. They&#39;re the intelligence agency with the most power and the least accountability but they are never satisfied.

Huge European reconstruction process and EU accession process will take place and it will occupy our minds for years. Ability to start these processes without huge land losses is a win for UKR. As a result Ukraine will become much more important from economical point of view to us too. Another important factor (albeit much more local) is that EU borders with Ukraine are now basically forgotten lands since they are virtually at the end of the world. At least two of these regions will get their new economic centers that are right at the border from Ukrainian side. They get markets we get economic gravity points for those neglected regions.

I don&#39;t believe the West or Russia can afford to lose, this is an existential war.<br><br>Let&#39;s just take a look at lend-lease, it was given during WW2 with nearly no expectation of repayment. Over 90% of the material value was never paid for, never even asked to be paid for. The aid was given under the pretense that it was used, returned or destroyed. Post WW2, the USA sold massive amounts of left over equipment to the UK for 10% of its value, which was spread out over like 50 years.

Like there are no other reasons for ANY of these things, it&#39;s just absurd. And a really silly metric at that. Of course it matters, but not as much as you&#39;d think. Of course public support is high, nobody is going to be okay and not want their cake too. That&#39;s life today, that&#39;s most people today, it&#39;s quite literally exactly what is expected and what we see over and over again. Nobody wants to actually pay the costs associated with anything, but they still want the result. We all complain, we all want to make more, work less, pay less, have more. That doesn&#39;t mean we won&#39;t pay for it, as a matter of fact, if there&#39;s one thing that should be painfully obvious is that we will continue to pay for it, regardless of how we feel.

Not even remotely close to the alleged levels of threat we supposedly experience today (have my doubts) at the very least.

23892,"Curious about Andrew‚Äôs motivation to do this interview on such a large platform as Lex‚Äôs YouTube channel. I would have pushed him on this and relevant meta-communication more directly. Additional observations: he plays the ego card well, insightful, psychologically-sophisticated enough to keep his narcissism in check. Likeable and eloquent, clearly well-above average intelligence. Master manipulator. Sprinkles interesting personal info about his history and family situation along with several value-based statements on the balance of personal freedoms vs security benefits. How much of what he told us is true and if so, how much his personal and unbiased opinion? Bottom line, he‚Äôs enjoying his performance which begs the question if he‚Äôs just having fun with the exposure (lifting the curtain for the audience to peek into the back scenes but not really saying anything we don‚Äôt already know) or being ‚Äúattractive‚Äù with other deeper motivations at play.

23893,"The interview was fascinating and informative. I really appreciate how Lex Fridman doesn&#39;t let his ego interfere. Mr. Fridman is so humble and open to ideas. He proposed certain questions that were dismissed casually. He gracefully moved on in a way that makes it easy to forget that he&#39;s a brilliant guy and deep thinker. And even more, seems to have a great heart. But his humility really does lead to hearing the thoughts of diverse participants, and that&#39;s a great opportunity for us all.<br><br>I gained more insights into the intelligence world from this than from many videos combined by former FBI / CIA experts.  I will have to add, though, that I found Mr. Bustamante&#39;s take on surveillance naive or even suspicious. His argument that mass surveillance probably wouldn&#39;t have unintended consequences because of being bureaucratically complicated is, frankly, pathetic. It&#39;s really not that hard. Look at the bizarre but actually-true-conspiracy theories mentioned in the video that never should have been. Yes, they have to be understood through the lens of time. Exactly. If we create &quot;times&quot; where government abuse of power seems reasonable, that&#39;s exactly what has happened and will happen. They&#39;re not going to reach out to Joe Policeman to arrest someone to then have his or her day in court with the obviously-to-be-dropped charge of using free speech. That&#39;s not how it went with Martin Luther King and the FBI, is it? Even look at how people in Canada had bank accounts frozen for supporting the trucker&#39;s rally. Or people suspected of a crime simply waiting and waiting in detention with ruined careers and relationships--even if found not guilty, the damage is done. All it takes is an emergencies act or redefining of a term / action to be &quot;terrorism&quot;, and poof, there ya go. Everything else is already in place. Since it&#39;s a super secret organization with immense resources to conduct operations all around the world, just use those internal capabilities instead of involving multiple general Gov agencies that may bungle things?  Just...yeah, that excuse really felt weak. Sadly, history teaches that when there&#39;s a sufficient power motive, never assume that something terrible won&#39;t happen because it&#39;s complicated or there are too many honest people to bribe / blackmail.",T3FC7qIAGZk,2022-08-10T19:06:31Z,0.0,58.0,True,False,False,0.08365079365079364,0.5535978835978836,1

23904,"Lex I have watched you from the very beginning and you have done and do an amazing job. I rarely write comments and inhave only watched till around the10min mark so far. You mentioned that the Federation of Russia went in and to this day, with a significantly less number of troops that not onlythe west says but also if you go through military history. Yes your statement is correct. But to say that Putin is ill informed because he is using less troops, well with Russia advancing when and where they want to. And with Russia continually and successfully achieving success.  My interpretation of success is by those initial goals stated at the  commencement of hostilities. You are an extremely highly educated man, but that makes no sense what so ever. Sorry mate i know its only ten minutes in but to always percieve Russia negativly by mentioning corruption already. By saying Putin only wants to hear what he wants. Or hes cronies pander to hes needs an that he lives in hes on fantasy land is absolutely tragic. You are Ukrainian i would like to know what your thoughts are on the Mindk 1 &amp; 2 agreements not being adhered to by the Ukrainian government. Considrring that the Ukrainian government, since 2014 had been agressivly attacking your own citizens for the past 8. I think there was well over 100,000 people killed by Kiev&#39;s aggression towards the Donbass. That death toll includes innocence of the frail and elderly right through to defenceless infants. I am no advocate or war and i dont live anywhere near the Europe. I&#39;m Australian for if any one is curious.  Where was the Trump/Russia collusion? Twenty four hours of everyday the media was just saying what they were told to say. All the lies and  hysteria brainwashing the masses constantly is disgusting. Remember WMD&#39;s, remember Operation Mockingbird?  Back then at least the CIA openly stated that they were influencing the media. I think they admitted it was wrong to mislead the American population at that time. Wonder why it is ok to spread fake news now.  So those agencies and governments that are there to abide by the law and protext the nation. Are the same ones fabricatiang the news to get the majority of the population believing the lies spun. Which then funds an untold amount of wealth to the military industrial complex so they can send your soldiers off with all the moat devastating weapons. Agent Orange, the after effects are still there today. Trees wont grow on mountains in Vietnam, with that being the case. 50 years is a long time do you think itbonly affected the trees an did not effect the local innocent inhabitants, to this day. Or depleted Uranium in Iraq, the horrific birth defects as a result of the radiation left behind is an absolute atrocity. And both of those wars were fabricated by using the false narrative with the Gulf of Tonkin an the latter with WMD, Colun Powell and the little vial of white powder. How many innocemt lives destroyed? How many soliders lives taken away from families.  Has anyone been held accountable for all of the lives lost??? Operarion Mockingbird in full swing... The dumbing down of the masses. Colin Powell has recently admitted that he feels sorry for that lie. Im not sure who falsified the narrative with the Gulf of Tonkin incident.  I only used to wars both should not of happened by adhering to international law. Was there any ramifications, any tribuneral for war crimes for all of those lives lost during those conflicts. Or those lifes still being lost decades later from the weapons used?

One‚Äôs inward obligation to self (self-satisfaction) as the primary important theme versus one‚Äôs outward obligation to society.  <br><br>I believe Trueman is correct in this assessment.  And I saw this come up near the end of this interview of Andrew Bustamante by Lex Fridman.  Fridman‚Äôs closing question to Bustamante was ‚Äúwhat is the meaning of life?‚Äù.

23962,"Oh. Yeah. He cracked the code, you can just go be whoever you want, take a new identity and just go. <br>Sorry, but what an idiotic idea, if I could, why would I even want to do that? Leave my family and friends? Never truly invest myself in anything with the main objective to con my way into socioeconomic status while producing little value for the common good. Put up a facade my entire life? I can believe Mr. Bustamante is a former CIA spy because he has some terrible life advice. <br>He forgets that not many people can learn and adapt at that rate and the resources(time,money,connections,etc.) it takes to begin with, not to mention other psychological, physiological and sociological baseline requirements. He seems too used to having people with these qualities around him, he can&#39;t understand how someone lives through their daily loops and the support it would require to be able to break out of that. I think he&#39;s idealizing what life is in this world.<br>Having kids, pets, a normal girlfriend etc. and a normal-ass job, being part of a family or social group, from the day you were born or grew into, and all the systems you have to interact with in your daily life shoving garbage or detours down your throat in all kinds of ways, it&#39;s impossible for the large majority to just go out and be whoever you want. It&#39;s a contrast to living a life of being told everything to do to develop yourself since a child or young adulthood, instead having those things shoved down your throat, getting fed the right things, engaged in the right things, not having to worry about it. They are freely provided and you are discouraged to take any detours. Then being an operating undercover agent working with a selective social group out on missions or in-house, maybe long-term trips that require you to learn new things, all resources provided, and engaging yourself in daily life in new and unique places and social circles all the time while sometimes doing crazy and important business for a secret agency. You get a lot of connections and probably earning a sick salary while paying for close to nothing yourself. He&#39;s very fortunate to have that and of course it makes him exceptionally intelligent to have walked that path, but he&#39;s delusional if he thinks everyone can go and do stuff like that from being stuck with their life things. It may be empathy holding them back or they were just dealt a shitty hand in life one way or another that resulted in disadvantages psychologically, physiologically or sociologically. <br>My point is that this guy is very sympathetic, he was probably trained to be, but displays little to no empathy in some of his statements. He seems to have more empathy for the government than normal people. <br>It wouldn&#39;t even be good for society if everyone took his advice. Society and nature are intricate things that require a lot of individuals to coordinate efforts for the common good through multiple generations. Personally I believe we need people to become more cooperative rather than individualists so that we all can some day live a productive and fulfilling life. <br>Sorry for the negativity and socialistic vibes in my comment.

The question of how President Trump handled classified material is complicated because as president he had the authority to declassify any government information. <br><br>Such a politically sensitive search would have to have been approved at the very highest levels of the federal justice system.<br><br>Besides the federal judge who approved the warrant, the raid likely needed sign-off by the director of the FBI himself ‚Äî Christopher Wray.

Experts pointed to at least two possible issues that could be under criminal investigation. The Presidential Records Act, and &quot;Willfully and Unlawfully&quot; mishandling public records, Section 2071 of the U.S. criminal code, calls for anyone found to have done so to be &quot;disqualified from holding any office under the United States.&quot; Toward the end of the administration, Mr. Trump ripped pictures that intrigued him out of the President‚Äôs Daily Brief ‚Äî but it is unclear whether he took them to the residence with him.<br><br>The optics of a sitting president&#39;s administration charging an opponent cannot be ignored, experts said.

If there are intelligent species out there that can make technology and terraform their surroundings then it&#39;s very highly likely that they went through the same evolutionary competition with other species on their respective planets and became bipedal creatures with big brains to think and plan, and also arms and fingers in order to manipulate their surroundings.

24386,"I don‚Äôt buy at all that this guy is not an agent, still. Hay un dicho: Once CIA, always CIA. He was dancing as fast as he could, and just glossed over very serious issues with the US Government. Mr. Bustamante is an apologist, a PR man, trying to change the narrative about his organization that he is still involved in.<br><br>I‚Äôm not angry about this stuff, just that when you get to 70 years old and you have been observing what my government has been doing over that time, you listen to excuses and call them out for what they are.<br><br>He was constantly saying about things like Project Northwood need to be seen in its time frame, like they did things then out of necessity that is no longer the way we do it. Shirley Temple in her autobiography Child Star said that when she was a child star, uncooperative child actors were placed in an old fashion icebox - without ice - and when let out of their confinement were told not to tell their parents or the child would be put back into the icebox. So when you find out things about say Weinstein demanding sex from actresses to receive roles, it makes perfect sense. People in charge give the authority to the people who come after, up to the current day. Who do they give power to? People of like mind. That is exactly what has happened with the CIA.

He conveniently omitted that since the Supreme Court has ruled that corporations are ‚Äúpersons‚Äù with the right of free speech, and paying off politicians is considered free speech, then politicians are no longer required to do the will of the people, real people. University studies have concluded that the will of the people has not been represented at all by the US Government since like 1995‚Ä¶<br><br>Edward Snowden was a third generation government servant, a boy scout of a man, who has completely changed his mind. Why was that? It was because he wasn‚Äôt a taxi driver who watched too much Youtube. He was a man who had his hands on the levers of power, led by men who put those levers in his hands, who saw that the idea of governmental accountability was completely void. That power in the US had become completely arbitrary, just because they said it was necessary. Mr. Bustamante was tripping over his words when he implied that Snowden had chosen to hold up in Russia. Ed didn‚Äôt choose it, the State Department turned off his passport when he arrived in Moscow, so he was stuck there. He was heading to Ecuador‚Ä¶<br><br>The Supreme Commander of the Allied troops on D-Day - Dwight Eisenhower - warned us about the Complex, and he chose to do that on his last night in office. Why did he wait? It is because he was pulling a Copernicus, who waited to release his findings that contradicted the geo-centric view of the universe on his death bed. Why? Because then there would be no one to persecute, the toothpaste was out of the tube. <br><br>I worked in Hollywood as a lighting tech for 30 years. During that time I worked on the series Sisters, with Swoozie Kurtz. Her husband was the actor who played the role in The Right Stuff of LBJ. I had the opportunity to speak with him. He told me that to play LBJ, he studied in depth about the man. He said that when LBJ announced to the American public that he would not run for president again, that part of the speech was not in the printed text of the speech before him. It was something that no one knew he was going to say.  Why did he do that? I think it was that he knew - probably better than anyone - that if he had shared his thoughts aloud about not running again there would have been a grassy knoll waiting for him, which thing has been hanging over the head of all US presidents since. LBJ knew that Eisenhower‚Äôs warning had come to pass, so he pulled a Copernicus‚Ä¶<br><br>The US is now falling at 32 ft. per second/per second, with no terminal velocity.

We have an FBI infected with woke activist ethics labeling people with the Constitution, historic flags, or comic book characters as terrorists and most of the agents are very alarmed how politicized it has become.  The intelligence apparatus has been secretly forwarding cases to local law enforcement and training LE to lie about their sources which completely invalidates a defense attorney&#39;s ability to defend a client and the courts have been complicit in it.  And the idea that we&#39;re no longer mass surveilling is absurd.  Even if we stopped surveilling, we&#39;d engage our closest allies to cross spy for us.  We&#39;re not gathering less information.  We are gathering more information because we have more connectivity and access than we did during Snowden leaks.

24527,"MI6 practically helped developed Mossad with Israel, and was also chief in transferring UK nuclear weapons development technology to Israel. If you&#39;re up against MI6 you&#39;re up against Mossad and vice versa. It wasn&#39;t long ago Mossad and MI6 pulled a nuclear scientist out of Iran together. How the link between these two wasn&#39;t even mentioned is a bit odd, as it&#39;s probably the strongest intelligence agency relationship there is - the special relationship when it comes to intelligence agencies isn&#39;t actually between UK and USA, it&#39;s between UK &amp; Israel. The CIA&#39;s reach is so large, it actually compromises more focused SIS&#39;s. <br><br>He also fails to mention the CIA isn&#39;t the branch that pulls of covert military activities, it has a separate paramilitary wing called the Special Activities Division. In the same vein, the UK&#39;s MI6 uses the SAS or SBS. <br><br>There&#39;s some basic information he&#39;s missing in this interview which tempts my suspicion over some of his claims. His company has been engaged in some very amateur services to the corporate clients to, which leads me to believe this is more about promoting his company than any real serious dealings in the past. He spent 7 years as a covert intelligence agent could be as much as being asked to sit as a pedestrian in a coffee shop for 2 years.... Not very convincing to me, and very surface level based knowledge he&#39;s presenting. I mean he seems like a nice guy...Moving from an air force combat op to the CIA is also a downgrade, it&#39;s not an upgrade. He probably earned less than $50k a year.<br><br>I say this as someone with 17+ years working in this industry, and honestly I feel like he&#39;s told Lex nothing that general joe public doesn&#39;t know by simply applying common sense and logic.

24528,"I guess Bustamante has a ‚Äúspectrum‚Äù of morality. I was interested in his characterization of his Air Force career, since I spent 30 years in the uniformed Air Force and several years afterward as a senior civilian. On LinkedIn, he says he is an ‚ÄúAir Force combat veteran‚Äù yet his record shows that he graduated from the Air Force Academy in 2003, took a position at USAFA initially in the athletic department (not combat), then moved to Moody Air Force Base where he lists himself as a junior officer, Air Force pilot training when  it appears he was a command post officer, someone who sits in a command center and monitors exercises (not flying). He was only at USAFA as an assistant coach (was probably an athlete at USAFA) for just over a year, then at Moody for less than a year (which is very strange, normally a junior officer assignment is for 4 years), then was moved to Malmstrom AFB, MT in the command post (not an ICBM launch officer although he lists himself as Nuclear Missile Operations). On his website he says he was the ‚Äúyoungest US Air Force Officer in history to command 200 nuclear ICBMs from an underground bunker with the highest possible military security clearance.‚Äù Well, no. He was a command post officer at Malmstrom, whereas the ICBM launch officers in Minuteman Launch Control Centers commanded their missiles (I was such an officer in the early 1980s). He never went to ICBM launch control officer training so he did not command ICBMs. On his site he says the Air Force asked to ‚Äúextend his Air Force Officer commission another five years.‚Äù The Air Force doesn‚Äôt do that. Period. The career just keeps going (you get another assignment) or you resign or are discharged, the latter usually for not making rank or poor performance reports. So again, he was just a junior officer sitting in a command center relaying information. He‚Äôs only there a little over a year and then leaves the Air Force before his Air Force Academy five year commitment is up. Graduates from USAFA in May 2003, leaves the USAF in May 2007 only four years later. Never went to pilot training or ICBM launch training and surely never saw combat. Also lists his rank as O-3, or Captain, when that usually doesn‚Äôt happen until four years IF you get promoted. Oddly, he then lists (again, LinkedIn) his time with CIA starting in Feb 2007, which would be while he was still in the Air Force. Maybe that was a typo but it does not match. If those dates are correct, my guess is that he had subpar performance reports while a junior USAF officer and didn‚Äôt make captain and was discharged before his 5 year USAFA commitment was served. But that is a guess. I can‚Äôt comment on his claims as a CIA officer, not my area. LinkedIn profile says he followed 7 years in CIA as a health advisor to CVS, which is also a bit odd‚Äîwonder why he left the Agency. But his Air Force career claims are strange and don‚Äôt quite come together. But there are no good ethical reasons to say combat veteran if one did not see combat, and no command post person saw combat, especially someone that junior. None of this is egregious, most of it I would consider inflating that aspect of his career, but does suggest someone, as he says, who is ethically ‚Äúflexible.‚Äù My recommendation as his unpaid YT advisor ‚ò∫Ô∏è would be to lose the ‚Äúcombat‚Äù in his LinkedIn ‚Äúabout‚Äù profile, clean up the Air Force career description (tone it down) in LinkedIn and on his website and then at least that aspect of the profile would be good to go. If he does that, which would take great ethical courage, as a fellow USAFA graduate, I wish he and his spouse great success.",T3FC7qIAGZk,2022-08-09T17:47:18Z,21.0,138.0,True,False,False,-0.013580917874396106,0.43890096618357477,0

24652,"This is a fascinating conversation, but I would ask that you take a far better look at what the US/NATO has done since 1990, as opposed to Russia&#39;s body count, then discuss who is truly being lied to.  I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s not Russians.  After that - what they hell on Georgia and Crimea?  Is there any desire at all for him to be honest about NATO&#39;s role in this history?  Why are you not calling out his bullshit on what took place in Donbass?  He is a one sided analyst, which makes him a very bad one. On WW II, we &quot;had&quot; to get involved there, Ukraine is unnecessary.  It&#39;s a proxy war for a DoD that needs an excuse to justify its existence and overthrow more governments,  ending with China. This is how insane the people in DC have become. He brings home how much we care about Ukrainians when he says we are using them as practice fodder for the military and it&#39;s horrible to accept that&#39;s what we are. Mossad has no soul.  They&#39;ve become a blight to human kind, including to Israelis.  Were it necessary to remove any agency on the planet, they would be it.  On 9/11, don&#39;t you suppose there&#39;s a lot more information we should have on that?  The dancing Israelis and so on, the passport, lots of stuff.  As for moral integrity, why there is doubt and a great deal of it would be black ops, torture, no accountability for these and many other things - total lack of integrity.  Snowden needed to put a light on what was happening just to try to get it honest, or in his case, prove it was not at all.  Maybe look at the FBI from 2016 on and Russiagate - tell me that wasn&#39;t a total wash and Comey knew it right then, as did the NSA. Years of bs and &#39;oh&#39; there&#39;s nothing there - including any investigation of Clinton or the DNC, at all!  Though I write this after the fact, what the FBI did to Trump, and the joke that was Alex Jones&#39; trial, makes clear the legal system is on the rocks.  Then lets look at Assange, again, persecuted for telling the truth. I get team loyalty, but the things these agencies have done in the name of national security were anything but.  The hero thing is just too much in that light.  As for the use of fear - this government uses fear porn all the time.  All the time.  Also, we are not a democracy, we are a republic. Thank you Lex!  There are criminals in every walk of life, the intelligence community too.  Ultra and how many other irreputable actions were taken and still are?  The cold war is no gd excuse.  People will be Mengele if we let them and there is no place easier to become one than an agency, or agencies, were they get a ton of money to do whatever they want to because the public is never told what they are up to.  Fauci would be my easiest example. On Bay of Pigs, I would think you knew that Nixon set that up under Eisenhower and Kennedy killed it. Very important note. Oh, and that his nephew believes the CIA did, in fact, kill him.  I get you can&#39;t imagine, but I suspect you don&#39;t want to.  The CIA history in Central America, namely El Salvador, is absolutely horrific and he has to know this.  And I get they operate under their master, that said, there will never be a good master if the bad one is allowed to continue.  As he said at the beginning, just let someone talk long enough.....  You get so nervous every time 9/11 comes up.  Makes one wonder what you&#39;re leaving out. Epstein was protected by the CIA who got him off the first time, did you miss that? There is no damn way he went as long as he did without high level protection.  I&#39;m smiling at listening to you try to explain how he was not exactly what he was, a well paid creator of files that can be used against every single high power person who may get out of hand.  On the espionage act, they keep digging until they can find a way to use it against someone they&#39;re after.  :)  Anyway, I&#39;m writing an essay.  I&#39;m done.

But when you talk about Freedom of Speech in the West you are a bit simplistic if you dive a bit deeper you&#39;ll see that you do have freedom of speech but you don&#39;t have the freedom to have an audience. Most journalists that are independent and are reporting facts that contradict the western narrative in the case of Ukraine are prosecuted, shut down, have their accounts suspended, de-monetized etc. So yes there is freedom of speech but only if it fits the state narrative, and if it doesn&#39;t fit you will just not have a platform to voice your opinion. A well-known example is Julian Assange. So saying that there is more freedom of speech in the West, unlike in Russia.

24665,"As most intelligence people, Andrew is a good story teller. But he also is a good bullshitter that is able to convince through persuasion, without really having the foundations for it. For instance when he is talking about the MBTI test, it is evident that he has no idea about the last 70 years of research into personality. MBTI is completely discredited in empirical personality psychology and has been so for a long time. The tests have for a long time been replaced by various test batteries from the Big Five paradigm, which has taken the findings from MBTI and weeded out the nonsense. The main problem with MBTI is that the test assumes a priori (before the fact) that people are either/or and distributed towards the extreme ends of the Bell curve. There is literally thousands of studies proving this to not be the case. Most people are in the middle of the Bell Curve, but MBTI assumes this away. His views on Ukraine seems also to be based on flawed intel and assumptions. It seems like he is still stuck in the trope most of us were in before the war: Russia has a competent military and command structure. They don`t.

24695,"The way this dude talks (he is indeed very smart/cunning), the decoys he uses, the way he excuses crimes against humanity and war crimes, EXECUTABLE-OFFENSES, simply by pointing to the fact that some of these now revealed conspiracies were hatched long ago (as if the Agency changed in the meantime. If anything it got worse!), or he points to the theory that there is a &quot;need&quot; for these illegal and evil tactics because nothing else equally effective is possible(MORONIC THEORY! And that is me already sugar-coating it), or those activities are claimed to be normal, natural, expected even, since &quot;everyone else&quot; supposedly does it; That one fact/observation alone speaks VOLUMES of the things that he chooses to NOT say.

His value proposition is that safety is more valuable than maintaining constitutional rights. This is where I (and many citizens) would disagree... To me... The whole point of having a military and intelligence apparatus is to protect not just the physical safety of the citizens of this country, but also to protect their rights. Most soldiers I know will talk that way... They&#39;re fighting for the rights of US citizens. We send men and women to die with that mentality. So clearly we believe as a nation that it&#39;s worth sacrificing lives to protect. Mass surveillance was itself a direct attack on the 4th amendment right of every US citizen. To me that&#39;s just as bad as physically attacking US citizens. It&#39;s for the same reason that Andrew said the US sees foreign data collection as a hostile offense. I&#39;d argue it&#39;s worth the risk of missing another major attack on the US if it meant maintaining our basic rights as citizens...

25169,"I&#39;m loving your guest selection today, Lex :) In regards to Russia winning, look into BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), they are supposedly supplying Russia or at least assisting them in getting around sanctions, as well as they have not protested against Russia invading Ukraine. Its a (relatively new) super group to oppose US hegemony. They even have their own currency. Bustamante is right about it being about resources and how Ukraine is a pawn to display Russia&#39;s strength. The sinews of war is money, money, and more money.<br><br>Regarding the Russian view of why they are doing things, I would say it is very similar to how US troops view all of our wars of aggression. Debt has been used to leverage power for a long time by the US, if you look at South America how US corporations worked in conjunction with the US military to privatize their resources. Major General Smedly Butler said war is a racket. I agree with Bustamante about it not mattering in regards to whether the west pays attention to it, but like he was suggesting, if Putin doesn&#39;t give a fuck about how the west feels, then it really won&#39;t affect the outcome. The west is mostly toothless in the outcome of the war. Russia will win and Ukraine is doomed.<br><br>When talking about surveillance of the US, sure there may be no secret police in the US that we know of, but what about all the data that they collect and yet no mention of how the NSA could be trading in that data with corporations. I recall reading news articles or watching something on Democracy Now that spoke to that (and also the Snowden reveals also reveal NSA&#39;s involvement with corporations for selling or trading data). So sure they won&#39;t be clamping down on people in an authoritarian way, but they sure can profit and use that metadata for things that people are not ok with.<br><br>With Snowden Bustamante is overlooking the fact that he fled to certain countries that are considered non-friendly or enemies of the US for the very reason that any &quot;Friendly&quot; countries would have served him up on a platter, and if you look at the US&#39;s history of jailing or silencing whistle-blowers, then it makes more sense why he would do what he did. But yeah, a person without a country is pretty fucked.<br><br>Bustamante seems to be a very &quot;the ends justify the means&quot; kind of guy, but I guess even he said so himself about what the CIA looks for in their operators and given the organizations history, its no wonder why US citizens have some reservations about the organization. And can you ever truly trust a spy? It may be well and fine to hand-waive or excuse the actions of the CIA during the cold war (as well as after that), but I think that&#39;s giving them too much of a pass. I do agree with Bustamante&#39;s view on 911 and conspiracies, but at the same time, conspiracies do get executed, so it&#39;s a slippery slope. <br><br>Regardless of how I feel about some of Bustamante&#39;s view&#39;s (some I agree with, others I obviously do not, but he is after all a &#39;former&#39; CIA agent, so his perspective is different than mine), really interesting guest for this one, glad you brought him on.",T3FC7qIAGZk,2022-08-09T00:58:53Z,0.0,1.0,True,False,False,0.21108270202020205,0.5544727633477634,1

The financial impact of the losses were estimated to be around ¬£1,500,000 (¬£1,000,000 in gold and ¬£500,000 ‚Äì ¬£600,000 in equipment and ships). ¬† The loss was still bitterly remembered in Great Britain 30 years later, at the height of the Napoleonic Wars.¬†<br><br>In 1782, Galvez‚Äôs subordinate set sail out of Havana to successfully capture the British naval base of New Providence in the Bahamas.¬† Spanish plans for the recapture of Gibraltar, invasion of Ireland and Jamaica were well under way in 1783 when the Brits agreed to Spanish terms for Peace.<br>The Spanish cost for the war was collected by a voluntary tax on citizens of Cuba, New Spain (including provinces of California, Texas and New Mexico).¬† Part of these proceeds were passed on to Comte de Grasse (commander of the French Fleet).<br><br>Lastly, American privateers (e.g., John Paul Jones) from 1780 to 1782 were given the green light to conduct anti-British Naval operations out of the Spanish ports of Bilbao, La Coruna, Cadiz, Algeciras, Santa Cruz de Tenerife as well as Havana and Guarico on Cabo de Frances in current day Haiti..<br>During the 1789 inaugural parade in New York City, the only foreign warship allowed in New York Harbor was Galvez‚Äôs flagship during the war, the brigantine Galveztown.¬† ¬†Galveston is named after Galvez.<br>¬†<br>So there we were in 1783.¬† Our Emperio was larger than the French, British and Dutch Empires combined, militarily superior and far wealthier.¬†¬† The world was ours for the taking.¬† Africa, Australia, New Zealand and everything West of the Appalachians and Upper and Lower Canada.¬† Today, we would have had mixed race Hispanics on five continents running the world.¬† <br><br>What happened?¬† United we were invincible but divided we fell easily.¬† Within one generation we would threw it all away!¬†¬† We are the only great Empire in modern history that was defeated from within.¬†¬† We have always been our most devastating enemy.   We royally screwed up by jumping ship on the Spanish during the Napoleonic Wars.¬† The Spanish are also partially to blame.¬† The historic Spanish ego, arbitrariness and capriciousness played a key motivating role in LatAm lack of loyalty at the time of Spain‚Äôs greatest need. ¬†¬†<br><br>Compare us to the loyal Australians, Canadians, New Zealanders and Americans who were there for England at her darkest moment in WWI and WWII.¬† Actions not only speak louder than words, they determine destiny of Empires!",T3FC7qIAGZk,2022-08-08T22:40:22Z,0.0,1.0,True,False,False,0.09986565158978952,0.36502494153356213,1

The way how guest appeals to the facts and calculations is so much hillarious, because it gives false confidence in rationale for him to speak about topics related to this war, which I cannot even relate at any approximation since its empty and hollow. I would like to stress out the next facts for everyone. The way how experts on the West calculated outcomes of the most important conflicts in 2021-22 is absolute disaster. They have been wrong in next crucial cases: Afganistan- Overestimation of Afgani goverment and Army, and underestimation of Taliban - outcome Taliban wins and Allies have to pull back, which lead to one of the biggest image losses for Allies, and in pacticular for US on 21st century so far; Ukraine- Underestimation of Ukraine Army and Ukranian people powers, and overestimation of Russian army. Outcome - we are entering the six month of the biggest continental war  in Europe since WWII, instead of three day special operation of capturing all Ukraine and putting it as puppet state of Russia. As well, calculations about economic sanctions on Russia because of invasion. It was said that these meassures will force Russia to stop the war quick, but it didnt. Nevertheless, they are working but not fast enough to help Ukraine win, as experts on the West suggested. And very last thing that I want give proper attention. The war could viewed as military and economic mix only, but this war showed that this view is false, since its limiting your assement possible outcomes. Matters of culture, idealogy, social structure, history and philosophy thinking matters very much. Its reason why Ukranian people fights so well, because we carry with our culture from our parents memory and traditions, which dates to generations back. The ideas of how we view the people and this word are unique and they cannot dublicated or simply copied by others in different place of planet. Take notice that Russian army targets not only military and civilians targets but Ukranian historical and cultural sites. Example which is the most significant for me museum, which was house of our defining philosooher Hryhorii Skovoroda. Russian top political military and political goverment wants to erase the idea of  Ukraine before others could study and learnt about it, because I genuily believe that we have so much good to propose for this world and for its prosperous future. In that context, I hope, its gives the clear understading that we are fighting for idea of Ukraine in the future, which believe have to defended now and developed in future. This idea has no way of measuring or putting price tag, because its priceless. For closing, I would like to quote President Reagan, who fits so well here: &quot;Above all, we must realize that no arsenal or no weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women.

I sometimes find myself disagreeing with certain things some of your guests say, based upon my own very unusual life experiences.  Your guest, Andrew Bustamante, made one statement that I believe is a dangerous thing for him to believe: that all humans crave human interaction and can be manipulated based only on that fact.  I learned at the age of four that nobody is reliable and nobody should be believed with more than a very minimal degree of certainty.  I have only met two other people who are as distant from other humans as I have always been, and both of those people seemed to me to be completely evil and were excellent manipulators of people.  I have never had any evil intent toward others without strong provocation, and generally empathize with anyone deserving of empathy. Since I have been grown, I have avoided other people and have had only a few close friends during my life. Though what Bustamante said may be true in most cases, it is definitely not true in all cases.
